<p class="drop-capy">Although in the present study I devote only a few pages to
the Greek time-reckoning, and am engaged for the most part
in very different fields, yet the work has arisen from a desire to
prepare the way for a clearer view of the initial stages of the
Greek time-reckoning. In the course of my investigations into
Greek festivals I had from the beginning been brought up against
chronological problems, and as I widened the circle so as to include
the survivals of the ancient festivals in the Middle Ages, more
particularly in connexion with the origin of the Christmas festival,
I was again met by difficulties of chronology, this time in regard
to the earlier Germanic time-reckoning. In the year 1911 I
published in <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Archiv für Religionswissenschaft</cite> an article on the
presumptive origin of the Greek calendar circulated from Delphi.
These preliminary studies led to my taking over myself, in the
projected Lexicon of the Greek and Roman Religions, the article
on the calendar in its sacral connexions. This article was worked
out in the spring of 1914. In it the emphasis was laid not on
the historical chronological systems, which have little to do with
religion, but on the question of origins, in which religion plays a
decisive part. In order to arrive at an opinion it was not enough
to work over once more the extremely scanty material for the origin
of the Greek time-reckoning; I had to form an idea from my
hitherto somewhat occasional ethnological reading as to how a
time-reckoning arose under primitive conditions, and what was its
nature. This idea obviously required broadening and correcting
by systematic research. The war, which suspended the continuation
of the Lexicon at its very beginning, gave me leisure to under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>take
this more extensive research. Certainly it has also imposed
some limitations on the work, since I could not make use of the
rich libraries of England and the Continent but had to be content
with what was offered by those of Sweden and Copenhagen. But
I am not disposed to regret this limitation too deeply. The material
here reproduced will probably strike many readers as being
copious and monotonous enough, and the numerous books of travels
and ethnological works which I have ransacked, often to no profit,
seem to hold out little prospect that anything new and surprising
will come to light. In this conviction Webster’s work has strengthened
me.</p>

<p>In two or three instances I have derived material of great
value from personal communications. For very interesting details
of the time-reckoning of the Kiwai Papuans I am indebted to Dr.
G. Landtman of Helsingfors, and Prof. G. Kazarow of Sofia has
sent me valuable information as to the Bulgarian names of months.
Dr. C. W. von Sydow of Lund has communicated to me details
of the popular time-reckoning in Sweden.</p>

<p>An exhaustive examination of all the material obtainable
would doubtless lead to a more exact conception of the details
of primitive time-reckoning. Above all, large districts with similar
peculiarities in time-reckoning could be more accurately defined.
The Arctic regions form a district of this nature. South America
again differs characteristically from North America; Africa, the
East Indian Archipelago, and the South Sea Islands all have their
peculiarities. The borrowings which have undoubtedly taken place
on a very large scale would be at least in part pointed out. This
working up of the material is however the task of the ethnological
specialist; my object is simply and solely to attain the above-mentioned
goal of a general foundation.</p>

<p>The observation of chronological matters varies greatly in
the ethnographical literature; I have gone through many books
without result, and in other cases my gains have often been small.
It is only in quite recent times that attention has been paid with
any great profit to this side of primitive life. Among the English<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
authors Frazer has drawn up a list of ethnological questions (printed
in the <cite>Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, 18</cite>, 1889,
pp. 431 ff., and also separately), paying due attention to time-reckoning,
which has had a lasting and happy result, as can be
seen especially in many papers in the <cite>JRAI</cite> of succeeding
years.</p>

<p>Of the works of my predecessors only one has had any more
elaborate aims&mdash;the ninth chapter of Ginzel’s handbook, which
deals with the time-reckoning of the primitive peoples, divided up
according to the different parts of the world. The significance of
the time-reckoning of the primitive peoples for the history of chronology
seems to have been only gradually grasped by the author
in the course of his work, since it is not until after he has touched
occasionally upon the question of primitive time-reckoning in the
course of his account of the chronological systems of the Oriental
peoples that he inserts the chapter in question between the latter and
the chapters on the chronology of antiquity. Ginzel has in many respects
a sound view of the nature of primitive time-reckoning, and
makes many pertinent remarks, but on the whole his treatment, as
is not seldom the case, is lacking in exactness and depth. I have
gratefully made use of the material collected by him, going back,
wherever possible, to the original sources. Of other previous
works must be mentioned the essays of Andree and Frazer on
the Pleiades,&mdash;the latter especially distinguished by its author’s
usual extensive acquaintance with the sources and by its abundance
of material&mdash;and the dissertation of Kötz upon the astronomical
knowledge of the primitive peoples of Australia and the South Seas,
an industrious work which however only touches superficially upon
the problems here dealt with, and in regard to the lunisolar
reckoning adopts the view of Waitz-Gerland:&mdash;“We can here discover
nothing accurate, since these peoples have conceived of
nothing accurately” (p. 22). I think however that we may fairly say
that this is to estimate too meanly the possibility of our knowledge.
Hubert’s paper, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Étude sommaire de la représentation du
temps dans la religion et la magie</cite>, is composed throughout in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
spirit of the neo-scholastic school of Durkheim. The present work,
on the other hand, is based upon facts and their interpretation.</p>

<p>The book was ready in the spring of 1917, but could not
be published on account of the war. Later I have only inserted
a few improvements and additions. As I was putting the finishing
touches to my work, there came into my hands, after a delay
due to the circumstances of the time, the <cite>Rest Days</cite> of H. Webster,
whose <cite>Primitive Secret Societies</cite> has gained him fame and
honour. This work deals in detail with a subject akin to mine,
but not from the calendarial and chronological standpoint here
adopted. Only upon the origin of the lunisolar calendar does the
author make a few general remarks (pp. 173 ff.), which however
do not advance the subject very far. In the chapters entitled
<cite>Market Days</cite>, <cite>Lunar Superstitions and Festivals</cite>, <cite>Lunar Calendars
and the Week</cite> he has brought together abundant material which
also concerns some of the phenomena treated by me; part of this
information will not be found here, since it is compiled from sources
inaccessible to me. For the same reason, because I could not
collate it for myself, I have not thought it advisable to introduce
this material into my book, especially since it adds no new principle
of knowledge and does not affect the conclusions I have
drawn. Moreover anyone who wishes to go farther into these
matters must in any case approach Webster’s careful work.</p>

<p>For the popular month-names of the European peoples I have
made use of the well-known extensive collections of Grimm, Weinhold,
Miklosisch, etc. In this chapter my object has not been to
make contributions to our knowledge of the popular months, but
only to bring out, by means of numerous examples, the parallel
between the popular names of the Julian months and the names
of the lunar months among the primitive peoples. More isolated
and disputed names are therefore omitted, and the names are given
chiefly in translation. I have made only one exception, namely
in the case of the Swedish lunar months, which really hardly belong
to my subject since they are a popular development from the
ecclesiastical calendar of the Middle Ages. I hope however to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
excused for this, in the first place on patriotic grounds, and secondly
because little attention has hitherto been paid to the matter.
In another place I have dealt fully with the Swedish names
of months, which are in the majority of cases not of popular
origin.</p>

<p>I have made out a list of authorities so that in the foot-notes
reference may be made simply to the name of the author; where an
author is represented by two or more works, the work in question
is denoted by an abbreviation. This list is to be regarded not as
an exhaustive bibliography, but merely as an aid to the quotations.
Where so many quotations have been made it has been thought
advisable not to use inverted commas, except in a few special
cases. The fact that the quotations are nevertheless given as far
as possible in the author’s own words must be held to excuse a
certain apparent inconsistency in the use of tenses.</p>

<p>Since I was obliged to include in my work the preliminary
stages of the time-reckoning of the culture peoples, I had to deal
with languages with which I was altogether unfamiliar, or only
imperfectly acquainted. I have therefore often availed myself of
the expert advice which has been readily given me by friends and
colleagues. For help in the complicated questions belonging to
the domains of the Semitic languages and Anglo-Saxon respectively
I am especially indebted to my colleagues Professors A.
Moberg and E. Ekwall. For occasional advice and information I
have to thank Docent Joh. Pedersen of Copenhagen (for the Semitic
languages), Prof. Emil Olson of Lund, and Prof. H. Lindroth of
Gothenburg (for the Scandinavian), and Docent S. Agrell of Lund
(for the Slavonic).</p>

<p>The English translation is the work of Mr. F. J. Fielden,
English Lector in the University of Lund, who has also read the
proof-sheets. I am greatly obliged to him for his conscientious
performance of a lengthy and by no means easy task.</p>

<h2 class="p2 nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy1">The ancient civilised peoples appear in history with a fully-developed
system of time-reckoning&mdash;the Egyptians
with the shifting year of 365 days, which comes as nearly as
possible to the actual length of the year, counting only whole
days and neglecting the additional fraction; the Babylonians
and the Greeks with the lunisolar, varying between twelve and
thirteen months and arranged by the Greeks from the earliest
known period of history in the cycle of the <em>Oktaeteris</em>. It
has always been clear that these systems of time-reckoning
represent the final stage of a lengthy previous development,
but as to the nature of this development the most daring hypotheses
have been advanced. Thus, for example, eminent philologists
and chronologists have believed the assertion of Censorinus,
Ch. 18, and have supposed that the <em>Oktaeteris</em> was preceded
by a <em>Tetraeteris</em>, even by a <em>Dieteris</em>. It may indeed at once
be asserted that such a hypothesis lacks intrinsic probability.
To account for the early development hard facts are needed,
and unfortunately these, especially in the case of the Greeks,
are extremely few. Where they are required they must be
sought elsewhere.</p>

<p>Setting aside all ingenious but uncertain speculations, our
only practicable way of proceeding is by means of a comparison
with other peoples among whom methods of time-reckoning
are still in the primitive stage. This is the ethnological
method which is so well-known from the science of
comparative religion, but the claims of which have been so
vigorously contested upon grounds of no small plausibility.
Fortunately this dispute need not be settled in order to prove
the validity of the comparative method for an investigation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
into the origin and development of methods of reckoning time.
The gist of the dispute may be expressed as follows:&mdash;The
ethnological school of students of comparative religion assumes
that the intellect of the natural man can only master a certain
quite limited number of universal conceptions; from these
spring more and more abundantly differentiated and complicated
ideas, but the foundation is everywhere the same. Hence our
authority for comparing the conceptions of the various peoples
of the globe with one another in order to lay bare this foundation.
The opponents of the school deny the existence of these fundamental
conceptions, and maintain that the points of departure,
the primitive ideas of the various peoples, may be as different
as the peoples themselves, and that therefore we are not
authorised in drawing general conclusions from the comparison
or from the fundamental conceptions themselves.</p>

<p>In the matter of the indication and reckoning of time,
however, we have not to do with a number of conceptions
which may be supposed to be as numerous and as various as
we please. At the basis lies an accurately determined and
limited and indeed small number of phenomena, which are the
same for all peoples all over the globe, and can be combined
only in a certain quite small number of ways. These phenomena
may be divided into two main groups: (1) the phenomena of the
heavens&mdash;sun, moon, and stars&mdash;and (2) the phases of
Nature&mdash;the variations of the climate and of plant and animal
life, which on their side determine the affairs of men; these,
however, depend finally upon one of the heavenly bodies, viz.
the sun. The claim that the comparative ethnological method
can be justified only when we are dealing with a narrowly
circumscribed number of factors is therefore here complied
with, owing to the very nature of the subjects treated. The
comparative method does not shew how things have happened
in a special case in regard to one particular people: it only
indicates what <em>may</em> have happened. But much is already
gained if we can eliminate the impossibilities, since from the
complete result of the development, no less than in other
ways, we may obtain a certain basis for our deductions.</p>

<p>For the investigation of primitive methods of time-reckoning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
no special astronomical or other technical knowledge is needed:
in fact, such knowledge has rather played a fatal part by
causing attention to be paid exclusively to the system of time-reckoning
and leading to constant attempts to discover older
and more primitive systems. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A priori</i>, indeed, we might venture
to state that a system is always based upon previous data:
unsystematic indications of time precede the system of time-reckoning.
These modest beginnings have been obscured from
view by the prejudice in favour of the systematic technical
and astronomical chronology. The only absolutely necessary
thing is a clear idea of the apparent motions of the heavenly
bodies, i. e. the sun, the moon, and the most important of the
fixed stars, and of the phases of the climate and the life of
animals and plants, which give the units of the time-reckoning.</p>

<p>For a statement of the course and phases of the heavenly
bodies and the units of the time-reckoning given by these I
refer to the article mentioned in the preface, the pertinent
sections of which are here quoted:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<em>The units of the time-reckoning</em> are given by the motions
of the heavenly bodies (expressed according to the Ptolemaic
system), and the more intimately these enter into the life of
man, the more important do they become. For this reason only
those units which depend upon the sun have asserted themselves
in our calendar, those depending upon the moon having been
dropped, except for the movable paschal term, which has been
kept on religious grounds. The units are the year, the month,
and the day. Other units more convenient for time-reckoning play
no part in the arrangement of the calendar since they are without
importance for practical life. <em>The day</em> (= 24 hours, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νυχθήμερον</span>)
is determined from the apparent motion of the heavenly bodies
about the earth, which is caused by the rotation of the earth
on its axis; but since the sun also, on account of the annual
revolution of the earth about it, runs through the zodiac in an
opposite direction to its daily movement and completes the
circle of the ecliptic in a year, a day will be a little longer
than a complete rotation of the earth. Or to put it otherwise:&mdash;The
time between two successive upper culminations of a star,
i. e. between the moments at which the star passes through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
the meridian-line of one and the same place (= attains the
zenith), represents an axial rotation: that is a <em>stellar day</em>. The
time between two successive culminations of the sun is, on
account of the annual motion of the sun (really that of the
earth), 3 min. 56.<sub>5</sub> secs. longer than a stellar day: that is a
<em>solar day</em>. The number of stellar days in a year is greater
by one day than the number of solar days. The stellar day
does not follow the variations of light and darkness and therefore
does not enter into the calendar. The difference between
the actual solar day, which is of slightly varying length, and
the mean solar day abstracted from it for the purposes of our
clock-regulated time-reckoning has no significance for antiquity.
The second unit determined by the sun is the <em>year</em>, the period
of a revolution of the earth about the sun. In relation to the
apparent motion of the sun it may be defined as the time which
the sun takes to come back again to the same fixed star. This
is a <em>stellar</em> or <em>sidereal year</em>, the length of which amounts to
365 days 6 hrs. 9 min. 9.<sub>34</sub> secs. The <em>tropic year</em> is the time
which the sun takes to come back to the crossing point of
the equator, viz. the vernal equinox. This is the natural year.
Its length varies a little; it is about 20 minutes shorter than
the stellar year. The <em>lunar</em> or <em>moon-month</em> is determined
from the visible phases of the moon. This term will be used
only when it is necessary to make an express distinction
between the lunar and our Roman month; the latter is a conventional
subdivision of the year which has nothing to do
with the moon, and has the name ‘month’ only because it
historically arose from the lunar month and in its duration
comes fairly near the latter. But when in relation to antiquity&mdash;apart
from Rome and Egypt&mdash;we speak of months,
lunar months are as a rule to be understood. The moon
revolves around the earth twelve times a year and a little
more: consequently it moves backwards in the zodiac much
more rapidly than the sun. The interval between two successive
moments at which the moon culminates at the same
spot at the same time as one and the same star is a <em>sidereal
month</em> (cp. the sidereal year); its length is 27 days 7 hrs. 43
min. 11.<sub>42</sub> secs., but it does not follow the phases of the moon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
and is therefore of no consequence for the calendar. The
phases of the moon are dependent upon the position of the
moon in relation to the sun and the earth. When the three
bodies are in a straight line (or rather in a plane perpendicular
to the plane of the ecliptic) in such a way that the earth is
in the middle, the side of the moon turned towards the earth
is completely illuminated and we have full moon: when the
moon is in the middle, the side turned towards the earth is
completely overshadowed, and that is new moon. In between
lie the separate phases of the waxing and waning moon. The
<em>synodic month</em> is the interval between two new moons and
comprises on an average 29 days 12 hrs. 44 min. 2.<sub>98</sub> secs.
This is the true lunar month: other varieties of month are of
no importance for us.</p>

<p>"<em>The risings and settings of the stars.</em> It has already been
remarked that the sun in the course of a year runs through
the zodiac backwards, so that one particular star culminates
3 min. 56 secs. earlier every day. Hence it is evident that if
we indicate the exact interval of time between the culmination
of the sun and that of one particular star, or name the star
with which the sun precisely culminates, we can determine the
day of the solar year. This is the principle of one method of
computing time which was very common among ancient and
primitive peoples, but has entirely dropped out of use in modern
times owing to our paper calendar. The stars are so to speak
the stationary ciphers on the clock-face and the sun is the hand.
In practice we naturally have to do not with the invisible culmination
of the stars but with the position of the sun and
certain neighbouring stars on the edge of the horizon, whereby
the matter becomes more complicated on the astronomical
side. For this observation the so-called circumpolar stars are
singled out, that is to say the stars situated so near the pole
that they do not set (e. g. the Great Bear). If the star rises
or sets simultaneously with the rising of the sun, this is called
the <em>true cosmic rising</em> or <em>setting</em>. If the star rises or sets
simultaneously with the setting of the sun, this is termed the
<em>true acronychal rising</em> or <em>setting</em>. These risings and settings
of the star are not visible, since the sun hides them by its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
light: the rising and setting are perceptible only when the star
stands at some distance from the sun, i. e. only the so-called
apparent rising and setting are practically observable. We
have already seen that the sun every day drops nearly 4
minutes behind a certain star. Assuming that sun and star
rise simultaneously on one day (true cosmic rising), then after
a few days have passed&mdash;the period varying somewhat
according to the latitude of the place of observation, the time
of the year, the size and place of the star&mdash;there will come a
day on which the star rises so early that it is visible in the
morning twilight, immediately before the sun appears. This
is the <em>heliacal</em> or <em>morning rising</em>. From this day the star
will rise earlier and earlier, and will therefore remain visible
for a longer and longer period. In the course of half a year,
commonly a little sooner or later, the time of rising will have
been pushed so far back that it will take place in the evening
twilight; when it is pushed still farther back the rays of the
setting sun eclipse the star and its rising is no longer visible.
The last visible rising of the star in the evening twilight is
the <em>apparent acronychal</em> or <em>evening rising</em>. After a few more
days the star goes so far back that it rises at the very moment
in which the sun sets&mdash;the true acronychal rising. The rising,
which is advanced constantly further into the light of day, is
no longer visible, but on the other hand we now see the
setting of the star. If it is assumed that the star is situated
on the western horizon, i. e. sets, when the sun is on the
eastern horizon, i. e. rises&mdash;and incidentally it is to be noted
that this position, when the star is not situated in the ecliptic,
may be divided by an interval of a larger or smaller number
of days from the opposite position, viz. star on the eastern, sun
on the western horizon&mdash;this is the true cosmic setting. The
star moves forward, i. e. its setting takes place earlier in the
morning, and after a few days it will be noticed in the morning
twilight immediately before it sets, and this is the first visible
setting in the morning twilight, the <em>apparent cosmic</em> or <em>morning
setting</em>. From this day the setting moves further and further
forward into the night and approaches the evening twilight.
At length it will be so near sunset that the star no longer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
sets in the night but in the evening twilight. The last visible
setting of the star in the evening twilight is the <em>heliacal</em> or
<em>evening setting</em>. After a few days the star has approached
still nearer to the sun: both set at the same moment, the true
cosmic setting. If the star stands in the ecliptic, the true cosmic
setting coincides in date with the true cosmic rising,
otherwise these are divided by a greater or smaller number of
days (see above). As the star moves on, a heliacal rising follows
again, and so on. Between the day of the heliacal setting and
that of the heliacal rising the star is invisible, since it stands
so near the sun that it is eclipsed by the sun’s rays. It has
already been remarked that we can determine the day of the
year by indicating the true rising and setting of a star at a
certain spot. As far as the apparent rising and setting are
concerned this indication can only be approximate, since the
visibility of a star depends on several variable factors&mdash;the
size of the star (because a smaller star, in order to be visible,
must move farther from the sun than a brighter one), the transparency
of the atmosphere, the keenness of vision of the observer,
the geographical latitude of the place of observation (since
the farther north or south the sun is, the more slowly, because
more obliquely, will it sink below the horizon). In this latter
respect, for instance, there is a perceptible difference between
Rome and Egypt. Only an approximate indication of time,
therefore, can be derived from the rising and setting of the
stars”.</p>

<p>The phases of the climate and of plant and animal life
cannot be particularly described, since they naturally vary so
much in different countries. It can only be remarked that
though they depend upon the course of the sun, yet in certain
cases, owing to the special climatic conditions of the individual
years, they may be to some extent advanced or retarded, and
further that the climatic phenomena of many parts of the earth,
especially in the Tropics but also in the Mediterranean countries,
recur with a far greater regularity than in our northern
climes, which are subject to such uncertain weather. Instances
are the trade-winds and monsoons, the dry and the rainy seasons.</p>

<p>Upon the above-mentioned units the system of time-reckoning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
will be based. The days are joined into months and the months
into years; only more rarely are the seasons interposed as
regular units of time. The system is like a chain the links of
which run into one another without gaps: each link is equivalent,
or as nearly as possible equivalent, to every other link
of the same class, and therefore need only be given a name
and counted, not necessarily conceived in the concrete, although
this is not excluded. This is the only genuine system,
a system of <em>continuous time-reckoning</em>, which excludes all gaps
in the chain and all links of indeterminate length. The relation
between the larger and the smaller units may be treated
in various ways, chiefly on account of the fact that the smaller
units do not divide exactly into the larger. Sometimes the
smaller units may be fitted into the larger as subdivisions of
the latter, so that they constitute the links of the chain formed
by the larger unit. The inequality referred to shews then
that the units vary to some extent in number or size (year
of 365 or 366 days, of 12 or 13 lunar months, lunar month of
29 or 30 days). In that case the beginnings of the larger unit
and of the first of the smaller units coincide. Thus in our
year New Year’s Day and the first day of the first month
coincide, but the length of the months varies somewhat. This
is an inheritance from the lunisolar year, in which also New
Year’s Day and the first day of the first month coincided and
the length of the month varied between 29 and 30 days, but
in addition the year varied between 12 and 13 months. This
mode of reckoning, in which the smaller units are contained in
the larger as subdivisions of them, will be termed the <em>fixed</em>
method.</p>

<p>But where the smaller units do not exactly divide into
the larger, both may also be counted independently of one
another without being equalised. A case in point is our week,
which is reckoned without reference to the year, so that every
year begins with a different day of the week. This method
of reckoning we shall term the <em>shifting</em> method. It is less
systematic than the fixed method, and we shall therefore expect
to find it play a greater part in earlier times than at the
present day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p>The system of time-reckoning, the continuous counting
of the time-units, represents the final point of the development.
It is our object to investigate the preceding stages, both systematic
and unsystematic. Certain important ideas which frequently
recur must however first be clearly set down. The
<em>time-reckoning</em> in the proper sense of the term is preceded by
<em>time-indications</em> which are related to concrete phenomena of
the heavens and of Nature. Since these indications depend
upon the concrete phenomenon, their duration fluctuates with
the latter, or rather the duration does not stand out by itself
but the phenomenon as such is exclusively regarded: the time-indication
is not durative, like the link in any system of time-reckoning,
but indefinite, or, to borrow a grammatical term, aoristic.
And setting aside these finer distinctions we also find that
the phenomena to which the time-indications are related are
of fluctuating and very unequal duration. Since the duration
is indeterminate and fluctuating, and the time-indications are
not limited one by the other but overlap and leave gaps, they
cannot be numerically grouped together. Here we ought really
to speak not of a time-<em>reckoning</em> in the proper sense, but only
of time-<em>indications</em>. But since the word ‘time-reckoning’ has
become naturalised, this method may be described as the
<em>discontinuous</em> system of time-reckoning, because the time-indications
do not stand in direct relation to other time-indications
but are related only to a concrete phenomenon, and through
that to other time-indications, so that they are of indeterminate
length and cannot be numerically grouped together.</p>

<p>If the number of dawns, suns, autumns, or snows that has
passed since a certain event took place, or will elapse before
a certain event is to take place, be indicated, the time that
has passed or is to pass will be defined, because the dawn
or the sun recurs once in the day, and an autumn or a snow,
i. e. winter, once in the year. This is the oldest mode of counting
time. It is not the units as a whole that are counted, since
the unit as such had not yet been conceived, but a concrete
phenomenon recurring only once within this unit. It is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pars pro toto</i> method so extensively used in chronology, and
by this name we shall call it<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>Since it must now be regarded as the natural course of
development that the systematic has gradually arisen out of the
unsystematic, and that the indication of concrete phenomena
following one another in the regular succession of Nature has
preceded the abstract numerical indication of time offered by
our calendars, the origin of the time-reckoning must be sought
not in any one system, however simple, but in the discontinuous
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pars pro toto</i> time-indications which are related to
concrete phenomena.</p>

<p>Our task is now to make clear the nature of these discontinuous
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pars pro toto</i> time-indications, since from them
proceeds, as order is ever evolved out of chaos, the continuous
time-reckoning, the calendar.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE DAY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy1">For primitive man the day is the simplest and most obvious
unit of time. The variations of day and night, light and
darkness, sleeping and waking penetrate at least as deeply
into life as the changes following upon the course of the year,
such as heat and cold, drought and rainy seasons, periods of
famine and plenty. But for the primitive intellect the year is
a very long period, and it is only with difficulty and at a later
stage that it can be conceived and surveyed as a whole. Day
and night, on the other hand, are short units which immediately
become obvious. Their fusion into a single unit, the day of 24
hours, did not take place till later, for this unit as we employ
it is abstract and numerical: the primitive intellect proceeds
upon immediate perceptions and regards day and night separately.</p>

<p>Evidence for this fact is furnished by most languages,
which are as a rule without any proper term for day and night
together, the circle of 24 hours. In writing English one sadly
misses the Swedish <i lang="sv" xml:lang="sv">dygn</i>, which has exactly the required significance.
The German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Volltag</i> is an artificial and not very happy
compound. The Greeks also formed a learned and rare (though
good) compound, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νυχθήμερον</span>. The usual method is to make use
of a term according to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pars pro toto</i> principle. This principle,
which we meet here at the outset and shall come across
more and more frequently in the course of the following pages,
is of great importance for the development of time-reckoning
since it shews how the original time-indication is discontinuously
related to a concrete phenomenon, and only slowly and
at a later period develops into a continuous numerical unit of time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>To describe the period of 24 hours, regarded as a single
unit for purposes of calculation, most modern and also the
ancient tongues employ the term that denotes its light part,
i. e. ‘day’ etc. Primitive peoples have no term to express this
idea and must describe the period by means of expressions
equivalent to ‘day and night’, e. g. ‘sun-darkness’ (Malay Archipelago)<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>,
‘light and darkness’ (Yukaghir in N. E. Asia)<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>. The
day is sometimes described by the concrete phenomenon which
it brings, namely the sun. The Bontoc Igorot of north Luzon
have the same word for sun as for day, <i>a-qu</i>, and the
time is reckoned in suns<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. The Comanche Indians reckon
the days in ‘suns’<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>, and in an Indian hieroglyph from the
northern shores of Lake Superior the duration of a three
days’ journey described is expressed by three circles, i. e. three
suns<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>. The western tribe of the Torres Straits reckons time
in ‘suns’, i. e. days<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. We may compare the well-known
primitive idea that the sun originates afresh for every new
day. The same thing is found in the language of signs. La
Billardière in the year 1800 relates of the very low Tasmanians,
now long since extinct, that they had some idea of regulating
time by the apparent motion of the sun. In order to inform
him that they would make a journey in two days, they indicated
with their hands the diurnal motion of the sun and expressed
the number two by as many of their fingers. This, he asserts,
is the only reference that can be found to any knowledge of
the movements of the heavenly bodies<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. So also according
to Homfray the natives of the Andamans describe a day by
making a circle with the right arm, i. e. a revolution of the
sun. We may compare the indication of the time of day by
pointing with the hand to the position of the sun, with which
we shall shortly have to deal. It is not improbable that the
designation of the day by means of an indication of the course
of the sun arose in the first place from the indication of the
position of that planet. The same method of expression is
found in the classical languages as a poetic or hierarchical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
archaism<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>, and also in medieval Latin. But <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἥλιος</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sol</i>, is also
used to denote the yearly revolution of the sun, i. e. a year,
and the year is denoted by <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φάος</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lux</i>. Still more striking and
more significant for the discontinuous method of reckoning is
the Homeric use of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἠώς</span>, ‘dawn’, instead of day, e. g. “this
is the twelfth dawn since I came to Ilion”,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> “this is the twelfth
dawn he lies so”,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and elsewhere. Aratus follows the Homeric
use<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>. The nature of this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pars pro toto</i> reckoning
will be further explained in the chapter dealing with the
year.</p>

<p>The counting of the days from the dawns is unique, and
the counting from the day-time is comparatively rare: the
Indo-European peoples of olden times, and indeed most of the
peoples of the globe, count the days from the nights. For this
it will be sufficient to quote Schrader’s statement:&mdash;“Moreover
it can hardly be necessary to give evidence for this well-known
custom of antiquity. In Sanskrit a period of 10 days is
called <i>daçarâtrá</i> (:<i>râtrî</i> = ‘night’); <i>nîçanîçam</i>, ‘night by night’ =
‘daily’. ‘Let us celebrate the old nights (days) and the autumns
(years)’, says a hymn. In the Avesta the counting from nights
(<i>xsap</i>, <i>xsapan</i>, <i>xsapar</i>) is carried out to a still greater extent.
As for the Germanic peoples, among whom Tacitus had already
observed this custom,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> we constantly find in ancient German
legal documents such phrases as <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">sieben nehte</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">vierzehn nacht</i>,
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">zu vierzehn nachten</i>. In English <em>fortnight</em>, <em>sennight</em> are in use
to-day. That the custom existed among the Celts is proved
by Caesar, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Bell. Gall.</cite> VI, 18, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spatia omnis temporis non
numero dierum, sed noctium finiunt</i> (‘they define all spaces of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
time not by the number of days but by the number of nights’).
The Arabians have the same practice. They say ‘in three nights’,
‘seventy nights long’, and date e. g. ‘on the first night of
Ramadan’, ‘when two nights of Ramadan have gone’, or ‘are
left’<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.”</p>

<p>For primitive and barbaric peoples the evidence is equally
abundant. The Polynesians in general counted time in nights.
Night is <i>po</i>, to-morrow is <i>a-po-po</i>, i. e. the night’s night, yesterday
is <i>po-i-nehe-nei</i>, the night that is past<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>. The New Zealanders,
in former times, had no names for days, but only for
nights<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>, and so with the inhabitants of the Sandwich Islands&mdash;and
the same is certainly true of the Polynesians as a whole,
since they describe the ‘days’, or rather the nights, by the
phases of the moon. The Society Islanders reckon in nights;
to the question ‘How many days?’ corresponds in their tongue
‘How many nights?’<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> So also do the inhabitants of the Marquesas<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.
In the Malay Peninsula periods exceeding a fraction
of a day are reckoned in nights<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. Among the Wagogos of
German East Africa the phases of the moon and the number of
nights serve as more exact determinations of time. The third
night after the appearance of the moon, for example, is the
day following the third night after the moon’s appearance<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.
Sometimes they say ‘day and night’ when they wish to describe
the full day of 24 hours. Occasionally they say that they have
worked so many days, with reference to the day-time only<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.
Except in the case of this tribe I have found no notes on
the African peoples; little attention seems to have been paid
to the point in their case. But the material for America abounds.
The Greenlanders reckon in nights<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>, though certainly we are
not told how those who live north of the Polar Circle reckon
in summer. So do the Indians of Pennsylvania<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>, the Pawnees,
who often made use of notches cut in a stick or a similar
device for the computation of nights or even of months and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
years<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>, and the Biloxi of Louisiana<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>. Usually however the
night is denoted not by this word but by ‘sleep’, ‘sleeping-time’.
Of the Kiowas it is expressly stated<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> that they reckon
the length of a journey in ‘darks’, <i>kon</i>, i. e. nights, and not in
‘sleeps’. If the question of the distance of any place arises
the answer is ‘so many darks’. It may even be doubted
whether ‘sleep’ is not sometimes translated ‘night’ by the
reporters. The Dakotas say that they will return in so many
nights or sleeps<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. Among the Omahas the night or sleeping
time marked the division of days, so that a journey might be
spoken of as having taken so many sleeps<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>. The Hupas of
Arizona<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>, the tribes of the North-East<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>, and the Kaigans of
the North-West<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> also reckon in sleeps. This mode of reckoning
is therefore the common one, that of the Comanches in suns is
an exception. Finally the natives of Central Australia also
count time in ‘sleeps’<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.</p>

<p>To reckon in nights is therefore the rule among the primitive
Indo-European peoples, the Polynesians, and the inhabitants
of North America. For Asia, which however is not so important
for primitive time-reckoning on account of the old and
far-reaching influence of civilisation in that continent, for Africa,
and for S. America evidence is wanting or is forthcoming only
in isolated instances. The reason probably is that in these continents
also time is really reckoned in nights, and our informants
have not noticed the agreement. This however is an
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">argumentum ex silentio</i>. Be that as it may, the fact remains
that at least half the globe reckons the days in nights.</p>

<p>The current explanation of this striking fact is given
by Schrader thus:&mdash;“Since the chronometer of primitive times
is the moon and not the sun, the reason for counting in nights
instead of days becomes almost self-evident”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>. This statement
is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i> not perfectly correct, inasmuch as there is and can
have been no people that has not observed the daily course
of the sun as well as the monthly phases of the moon: as chronometer
neither of the two bodies is older than the other. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
difference lies in the development of the time-reckoning. In
point of fact an inner connection seems to exist between the
counting of the days in nights and the designation of the days,
or rather the nights, of the month according to the phases of
the moon, to which we recur further on. Even such low races
as the tribes of Central Australia already have names for the
phases of the moon, from which they reckon time<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>, but unfortunately
we are not told how many. The Polynesians have
very elaborately developed these, so that every day has its
separate name. The Wagogos also use the phases of the moon
as indications of time. The Arabs speak of ten phases of the
moon, combining three days under each name. The Indians
know the phases of the moon, but seem to have named and
made use of them only roughly: the only tribe that possesses
a list of the names of the days of the moon-month is the
Kaigans<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>, and unfortunately this list is incomplete. Moreover
there are no indications that the primitive Indo-European peoples
distinguished the phases of the moon otherwise than roughly.
The finer distinction and nomenclature of the moon-phases, so
that in the end each day comes to have its separate name, is
clearly a very far advanced special development: the use of
the word ‘night’ to express the period of 24 hours is much
older. A causal connection, such as Schrader and others have
maintained, must lie in the fact that the period of 24 hours is
named after the phases of the moon and consequently the day
itself is reckoned in nights. But this is only a comparatively
isolated and advanced development, against which must be set
the fact that the Indians and so primitive a people as the
Australians use not the word ‘night’ but ‘sleep’, which has
nothing to do with the moon.</p>

<p>The explanation must therefore be sought elsewhere, and
is one which also applies to the use of the word ‘winter’ for
year etc. Primitive man knows only concrete indications of
time, and in reckoning prefers to use a concrete and clearly
visible point of reference. The complete day of 24 hours is
unknown to him and so he <em>must</em> reckon according to the principle
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pars pro toto</i>, and as a matter of fact it is possible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
to reckon just as well from a part of the whole as from the
whole itself, provided that the part chosen is one that only
recurs once every day. The day itself, with its various occupations,
offers no such point of reference unless the reckoning is
based upon the daily appearance of the sun, which is also
actually done in certain cases. However in the daily course
of the sun, as we have already seen, two features, its duration
and the changing position of the sun, stand out prominently:
but it is easier to reckon from points than from lengths, which
divert the attention from the number. Now the sleeping-time
is necessarily bound up with each day, yet it has no separate
parts, or acquires them only later among certain peoples. The
time between going to sleep in the evening and waking in the
morning appears as an undivided unit, a point. It offers for
reckoning a convenient basis in which no mistake or hesitation
is possible such as can occur in the various occupations that
fall within the period computed. The method of reckoning in
nights is merely an outcome of the necessity for a concrete
unmistakable time-indication: it is a typical example of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pars pro toto</i> principle and time-reckoning, which, on the
psychological grounds just mentioned are especially favoured
in the counting.</p>

<p>For the indication of a point of time within the day the
reference to the course of the sun is the means that lies
nearest to hand, and the indication can indeed be given quite
concretely by means of a gesture in the direction of the heavens.
This language of signs is especially common in Africa. The
Cross River natives of Southern Nigeria indicate the time by
pointing to the position in the heavens which the sun occupies
at that time of the day<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>. When someone asked a Swahili what
time it was, he answered, “Look at the sun”, although this tribe
knew other ways of indicating time<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>. The Wagogo in order
to shew the time of day indicate with the hand the position
of the sun in the heavens<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>. In Loango the people indicate
the time satisfactorily enough from the motion of the sun, in
divisions of two hours, by dividing the vault of the sky with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
outstretched arm, often using both arms as indicators<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.
Moreover most peoples have descriptive expressions for parts
of the day, as for instance the inhabitants of the Lower Congo<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>,
the Masai of East Africa, who estimate the time of day from
the position of the sun<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>, and the Hottentots, who express with
certainty and clearness both points and duration of time by
referring to the position of the sun<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>. In Dahomey the natives
tell the hours by means of the sun; they say that the sun is
here or there, in order to give the time of day<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>. The Caffres
are able to give the exact time of day by pointing with
outstretched arm to the spot at which the sun appears at the
time they wish to indicate. So, for example, when the Caffre
wishes to shew that he will come at two o’clock in the afternoon
of the next day, he will say, “I will be here to-morrow,
when the sun is there”,&mdash;pointing to the position occupied
by the sun at 2 p. m.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>. The Waporogo of German East
Africa estimate the divisions of the day from the position of
the sun, which they indicate with outstretched arm. When
the arm is vertically raised, that means 12 o’clock noon,
and the other hours of the day they are able to give with a sure
instinct by means of a greater or lesser inclination of the arm
towards the body, corresponding to the position of the sun<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.
In other parts of the world we find the same thing. Thus in the
New Hebrides the hours of the day are indicated by pointing
with the finger to the altitude of the sun<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>. If a native of
Australia is asked at what time anything took place or is
going to take place, his answer will take the form of pointing
to the position which the sun occupied or will occupy in the sky
at that particular time<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>. The Bontoc Igorot of Luzon point to
the heavens in order to indicate the position the sun occupied
when a particular event occurred<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>. The Kanyans of Sarawak,
if asked at what time anyone will arrive, point to the sun
and say, “When the sun stands there”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>. In the Dutch East
Indies the time of day is given from the position of the sun<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
The inhabitants of Java divide the day into ten natural but
vague and unequal subdivisions, and for astrological purposes
the day of 24 hours is divided into five parts. They also determine
the time of day by the length of the shadow and by the
working-time, but the most common method is by pointing to
the situations of the sun in the heavens, when such and such
an event took place<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>. In order to indicate the time the natives
of Sumatra also point to the height in the sky at which the sun
stood when the event of which they are speaking occurred<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>.
The natives of the western tribe of the Torres Straits, though
they have learned to tell the time from the clock, also know
how to give it very accurately by observing the height of the
sun<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>. The Tahitians determine the six parts of their day from
the sun’s altitude<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>. Among the Omaha Indians the sun indicates
the time of day. A motion towards the zenith meant
noon, midway between the zenith and the west, afternoon, and
midway towards the east, forenoon<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>. The Karaya of Central
Brazil divide up the day according to the position of the sun.
Indications of time are given by pointing with the hand to the
place occupied by the sun at the time in question<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>.</p>

<p>This method of indicating the time of day is quite satisfactory,
especially in the tropics and for primitive needs, and
only more rarely does it give place to other methods, the chief
of which is the observation of the length of shadows. The
Javanese know this latter method but do not often use it. In
their old writings we find a traveller described as setting out
on his journey or arriving at the end of it when his shadow was
so many feet long<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>. The Masai usually estimate the time of
day from the position of the sun, but more rarely from the
length of the shadows<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>. When the shadow measures nine feet,
the Swahili say, “It is 9 o’clock (<em>sic!</em>)”<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>. To indicate the time
of day or to represent a distance the Cross River natives use
the length of shadows. They have however in most of their
houses a curious species of sun-dial, a plant about 50 cm. high,
with violet-white flowers. The flowers gradually begin to open<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
at sunrise, by noon they are wide open, and they gradually
close again between noon and sunset. One of these plants is
placed in every garden and enclosed within little stones<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>. To
the south of Lake Nyassa the time of day is reckoned either
from the position of the sun or from the length of the shadow
thrown by a stick, <i>nthawe</i><a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. The Society Islanders among their
numerous expressions for the time of day include two which
have reference to shadows, ‘the shadow as long as the object’,
‘the shadow longer than a man’<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>. The Benua-Jahun, a primitive
tribe of the Malay Peninsula, indicate the progress of the
day by the inclination of a stick. Early morning is represented
by pointing a stick to the eastern horizon. Placed erect
it indicates noon, inclined at an angle of about 45° to the west
it corresponds nearly with three o’clock, and so on<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>. This
practice is doubtless connected with the common use of a stick
in the Indian Archipelago for observations of time, and is by
no means primitive. The ancient Athenians seem to have indicated
time by measuring off with the foot the length of the
shadow cast by their bodies upon the level ground before them
as they stood. At all events the length of shadows served to
indicate time, cp. Aristophanes, <cite>Ekkles.</cite>, 652, “when the staff
is ten feet, to go perfumed to dinner”<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>. The gnomon which,
according to Herodotus II, 109, the Greeks borrowed from the
Babylonians was an upright stick the shadow of which was
measured: it was also an important instrument for astronomical
observations<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>. Here however we are already at a highly developed
stage and know nothing about the origins.</p>

<p>The indication of time from the position of the sun is
really only satisfactory in the tropics, where the sun always
stands very high and the length of its daily course is not exposed
to too great variation. Where the sun is much lower in
winter than in summer, and the length of the day varies greatly
at different times of the year, the method ceases to be practicable.
If descriptive expressions of one kind or another are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
not resorted to, other means must be found. Above all it is
important to determine the fixed point which divides the day into
two parts, i. e. noon. In the living-room of the houses of the
Scanian peasants, which were always built ‘according to the
sun’, i. e. facing east and west, there was in the southern window-sill,
beside the middle shaft of the frame, a line which was
called the ‘noon-line’. When the shadow of the shaft fell parallel
with this line it was noon. This device is not exactly primitive,
since windows in the room, more particularly in the wall,
belong to a quite advanced stage of civilisation. But on the
other hand such customs as the determination of noon and
other moments of the day from the position of the sun above
certain points on the horizon&mdash;elevations and hills&mdash;are old. In
Iceland the divisions of the day were, and still are, determined
from the visible course of the heavenly bodies. The people
imagined that the sun in the course of a day and a night ran
through the eight equal regions of the heavens (<i>ættir</i>, sing. <i>ætt</i>).
The time of day was determined from the position of the sun
above the horizon by the selection in every house of certain
outstanding points within the range of vision to serve as ‘day-marks’
(<i lang="is" xml:lang="is">dagsmǫrk</i>, sing. -<em>mark</em>)&mdash;where these were lacking,
small piles of stones were erected for the purpose&mdash;so that
when the sun stood above one of these marks a certain time
of day was given. The most important times thus determined
were <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">rismál</i> or <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">miðr morgin</i> (6 a. m.), <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">dagmál</i> (9 a. m.), <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">hádegi</i>
(12 o’clock noon), <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">míðmundi</i> (1.30 p. m.), <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">nón</i> (undoubtedly
originally called <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">undorn</i> and also <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">eykt</i>, 3 p. m.), <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">miðr aptann</i>
(6 p. m.), and <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">nattmál</i> (9 p. m.). These indications in hours
are however only approximate, since the time varies according
to the position of the place in question<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>. The word <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">eykt</i> really
designates any of these approximately three-hour divisions; but
since the length of the day varies enormously so far north, the
business of everyday life leads to an attempt at systematising,
e. g. <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">rismál</i> = ‘the time of rising’. The spot which the sun
has reached at one of these divisions is therefore called <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">dagmálastað</i>,
<i lang="is" xml:lang="is">nónstað</i>, <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">eyktarstað</i> etc. This mode of determining<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
time must be old since it is also found in Scandinavia, where
it has given names to many mountain-peaks. In Baedeker I
have only noticed:&mdash;<i lang="is" xml:lang="is">Middagsfjället</i> in Jämtland, <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">Middagshorn</i>
in Norangdal, <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">Middagshaugen</i> in Aardal, Sogn, <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">Middagsnib</i> in
Oldendal in the Nordfjord district, <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">Middagsberg</i> on the Nærøfjord
in Sogn, <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">Nonsnib</i> above Loen Water in Nordfjord, <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">Solbjørgenut</i>
in the Nærøfjord, Sogn. From Fritzner’s Old Norwegian
Lexicon (s. v. <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">eyktarstað</i>) I take:&mdash;<i lang="is" xml:lang="is">Durmaalstind</i>, <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">Rismaalsfjeld</i>,
<i lang="is" xml:lang="is">Nonsfjeld</i>, <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">Natmaalstinden</i>, <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">Middagsfjeld</i> in Tromsö
‘amt’ and in Finnmarken, <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">Eyktargnipa</i> and <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">Undornfjeld</i> in Mule
Syssel in Iceland; the peak of the latter lies in the <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">nonstað</i>.
Such names are common in Norway. In Sweden there are
further:&mdash;<i lang="is" xml:lang="is">Middagsberget</i> in Dalecarlia = Gesundaberget, just
south of Mora; the name is found again in Härjedalen, in addition
to <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">Nonsberget</i>, <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">Nonsknätten</i> and <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">Middagshognan</i>. Lidén<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
instances similar names in S. Sweden and in England, and also
those formed with <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">mosse</i>, ‘swamp’, <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">vik</i>, ‘bay’, and <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">åker</i>, ‘field’.
It is easy to understand why <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">middag</i>, ‘noon’, everywhere predominates
as a nomenclator. The Lapps also indicate time by
the position of the sun in relation to the surrounding natural
objects<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>.</p>

<p>The gestures may be accompanied by descriptive expressions,
as among the negroes, or replaced by them, which
seems to be the rule among other peoples. The latter practice
offers the further advantage of being available in the night-time,
when it is necessary to mention a point of time after
dark. The Kayans denote the time of day by pointing to the
position of the sun, but for morning and evening they also use
the expressions ‘when the sun has risen’ or ‘set’<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>. Expressions
for the most important divisions, sunrise and sunset (= morning
and evening) and noon, are found among all peoples. Even
the tribes of Central and Northern Australia have words e. g.
for evening and for morning before sunrise<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>. The richness of
the terminology however varies exceedingly. The Indians divide
the day into three or four rough divisions only. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
Seminole of Florida divided up the day by terms descriptive of
the positions of the sun in the sky from dawn to sunset<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>: unfortunately
we are not told what these words were or how
many of them existed. Among the Hopi of Arizona there is
every evidence that the time of day was early indicated by
the altitude of the sun<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>. The Omahas know no smaller divisions
of the day than morning, noon, and afternoon, to which
certainly must be added the transitional periods of sunrise and
sunset<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>. The Occaneechi of Virginia measure the day by
sunrise, noon, and sunset<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>. The Algonquins of the same province
mention the three times of the rise, power, and lowering
of the sun<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>. Many tribes however had four divisions<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>, e. g.
the Natchez of Louisiana, who divided the day into four equal
parts: half the morning, until noon, half the afternoon, until
evening<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>. But there is also a richer terminology, e. g. the
Kiowa words for dawn (‘first-light’), sunrise (lit. ‘the-sun-has-come-up’),
morning (lit. ‘full-day’), noon, earlier afternoon until
about 3 o’clock, late afternoon, evening (lit. ‘first-darkness’)<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>;
and in particular among the Statlumh of British Columbia:
dawn (‘it-just-comes-day’), early morning (‘just-now-morning’),
morning light (‘just-see-things’), full light (‘just-now-day’), sunrise
(‘outside-sun’), early morning (midway between sunrise and
noon), noon (up till about 2 p. m.), middle of the afternoon,
about 4 p. m., ‘three-fourths-of-the-day-have-gone’, ‘sun-sitting-down’,
‘the-sun-gone’,’evening-creeping-up-the-mountain’ (this refers
to the line of shadow on the eastern mountains), ‘reached-the-top’,
i. e. the line of the shadows, twilight, ‘getting-dark’,
night, darkness, pitch dark<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>.</p>

<p>Of the Indians of S. America little is reported. ‘The-sun-is-perpendicular’
was the expression for noon on the Orinoco<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>.
The Indians of Chile had words for morning twilight, dawn,
morning, noon, afternoon, evening, evening twilight, night, and
midnight<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>.</p>

<p>The terminology for the parts of the day is especially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
rich in Africa, a fact which is connected with the refinement
of the observation of the sun’s position resulting from the custom
of indicating this by a gesture in the direction of the heavens.
Such simple indications as those of the Babwende for noon,
‘the-sun-over-the-crown-of-the-head’, and for midnight, ‘the-silence-of-the-land’<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>,
are rare. A number of elaborate time-indications
are as a rule employed. The Wadschagga say at six
o’clock in the morning ‘the sun rises’, at twelve o’clock ‘the
sun rests on his cushion’ (like a tired porter), from twelve to
one ‘the sun goes straight on’, about two it ‘bows’, about six
it ‘falls down’, or ‘spreads its arms out’, like a man in the act
of falling<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>. The terms used by the Bangala are:&mdash;about 2 a. m.,
the lying fowl; 3, the lying bird; 4, the first fowl; 4&ndash;5, the sun
is near; 5, not translated; 5.<sub>30</sub>&ndash;6, the dawn; 6, the sun is come;
6.<sub>15</sub>&ndash;7, <i>ntete</i>; 12 noon, 2&ndash;3, 3&ndash;4, not translated; 6, the fowls
go in, or the sun enters, or the sun darkens; 6.<sub>30</sub>, twilight finishes;
11&ndash;12, one set of the ribs or one side of a person, meaning
that a person turns from lying on one side over on to the
other; 12 midnight, second division or second half<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>. In Bornu
the expressions for the time of day are formed by the aid of
the word <i>dinia</i> = ‘world’, ‘universe’, ‘sky’. From about 4 to 5
‘the world cuts the aurora’; at 6 ‘the world is light’; at 12
‘the sun is in the centre of the world’. Afterwards follow
‘it is evening’, twilight, night, midnight. Since the people are
Mohammedans they also have expressions for the hours of
prayer<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>. The expressions used by the Shilluk of the White
Nile are translated<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>:&mdash;“The first morning, twilight becomes
visible, morning dawn, morning, the earth is morning (it is
morning)&mdash;the difference here is not evident&mdash;noon, the sun is
in the zenith, the sun begins to sink (afternoon), it is afternoon,
the sun is setting, the sun has set, it is night, at night, midnight.”
The Yoruba divide the day into early morning, morning
or forenoon, noon (when the day is ‘perpendicular’),
shadow-lengthening or afternoon, evening or twilight<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>. The
Masai distinguish the following parts of the day:&mdash;at 4 a. m. it
is ‘not-yet-early’; at 5 it is ‘early’; somewhat later come dawn,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
twilight (about 5.<sub>30</sub>, ‘the-sun-is-still-far-off’), and sunrise (‘the-sun-shews-himself-a-little’
or ‘rises’). From 8 to 10 it is ‘still-early’,
towards 11 they say ‘the-sun-is-not-yet-perpendicular-overhead’,
at 12 ‘the-sun-is-perpendicular-overhead’. The afternoon
is usually expressed by ‘the-shadow-is-turned-round’. This phrase
is often used for the period from 3 to 5 p. m. In particular,
12&ndash;2 = ‘the-sun-is-broken’, 2&ndash;4 = ‘afternoon-now’, 4&ndash;6 is evening,
5 = ‘the-sun-goes-down’, sunset glow = ‘the-twilight-follows-the-sun’.
With the coming of darkness begins the <i>tapa</i>, which
lasts until 8 o’clock, when the people usually go to rest<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>. Another
authority gives the following list:&mdash;Evening, when the cattle
return to the kraal just before sunset; night-fall, or the hour
for gossip, before the people go to bed about 8 o’clock; then
night, midnight, and the time when the buffaloes go to drink
(about 4 a. m.), this latter is the hour before the sun rises;
then ‘the blood-red period’ or ‘the time when the sun decorates
the sky’, this is the hour when the first rays of the sun redden
the heavens; after that morning, when the sun has risen. There
are also hours called ‘the-sun-stands-(or is-)opposite-to-one’
(midday), and ‘the-shadows-lower-themselves’ (1&ndash;2 p. m.)<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>. The
Nandi, north-east of the Victoria Nyanza, divide the day into
six parts with separate names: 5&ndash;6 a. m., 6&ndash;9 a. m., 9 a. m.&ndash;2 p. m.,
2&ndash;6 p. m., 6&ndash;7 p. m., night. They have moreover
a highly developed terminology for the hours of the day, to
which we shall return later. The Baganda distinguish the
following times of day:&mdash;night, midnight, cock-crow, early
dawn, morning, ‘little sun’ (early morning from 6 to 9), full or
broad daylight (9&ndash;2), midday, afternoon, evening<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>. The lower
classes sometimes reckon from the meal-times, breakfast at 7
a. m., dinner at noon, and supper at 6 p. m. Women engaged
in rough work in the gardens spoke of the time at which such
and such an event took place as that of the first or second
pipe, the first marking an interval of rest at 8 a. m., the second
being smoked when work ceased at 10 a. m.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>. The expressions
for the times of day among the Thonga of South Africa have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
been translated and explained as follows:&mdash;“The dawn is
called <i>nipandju</i>; then come <i>tlhabela sana</i>, the time when the
rays of the sun (<i>sana</i>) are piercing; <i>hisaka sana</i>, when they
are burning; <i>nhlekani</i>, the middle of the sky, or <i>shitahataka</i>,
the maximum point of heat; then <i>ndjenga</i> or <i>lihungu</i>, the afternoon;
the time when the sun goes down (<i>renga</i>); <i>ku pela</i> or
<i>ku hlwa</i>, when it reaches the horizon; and <i>inpimabayeni</i>, the
twilight, literally ‘the time when you do not easily recognise
strangers coming to your village because it grows dark’”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>. It
is remarkable here that many indications are given from the
increasing heat and not from the position of the sun. The
Hottentots distinguish morning and evening twilight, morning
brightness, i. e. the time of clear day shortly before sunrise
(the native name is given because about dawn it is usually most
perceptibly cold), and evening brightness, ‘the red twilight’.
‘Little children’s twilight’ was in some places the name given
to the time of the first noticeable diminution of light after
sunset, in accordance with the belief that at this hour most
children were born. Afternoon and morning were only approximate.
A distinction was made between evening and late
evening, which extended till long after sunset<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>. The author
just quoted remarks that in this case one is struck by the fact
that while the limits of day and night are elaborately marked
out, of the hours of day itself only noon is brought into prominence.
The same is the case with most peoples who
possess a more highly developed terminology of this nature, and
the circumstance is perfectly natural, since the concrete differences
in the phenomena of light and of the heavens become
so great and so easily visible during the transition from day to
night and night to day. As soon as the sun has risen a little
in the heavens these differences consist chiefly in the position
of the sun and in the increasing heat. Here the language of
signs is really more expressive.</p>

<p>The aboriginals of the Andaman Islands have terms for
the following times of day:&mdash;dawn, the time between this and
sunrise, sunrise, the time between sunrise and 7 a. m., morning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
(three different expressions), noon, the time from noon
to 3 p. m., from 3 to 5, from 5 to sunset, sunset, twilight,
from night-fall to midnight, midnight<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>. In Busang (the common
commercial language of the Bakau) as spoken by the Mendalam
Kayan of Borneo the different times of day are named:&mdash;<i>dow</i>
(day) <i>bekang</i> (open, split) = 6 a. m.; <i>dow njirang</i> (to shine)
<i>mahing</i> (powerful) = about 9 a. m.; <i>dow negrang</i> (upright) <i>marong</i>
(real) = about 12 noon; <i>dow njaja</i> (great) = about 4 p. m.;
<i>dow lebi</i> (little) = about 6 p. m.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> The terms used by the Islamite
Malayans of Sumatra are mingled with Arabic loan-words,
which I indicate by (Ar.):&mdash;6 a. m. (Ar.) dawn, 9 ‘half of the
rising’, 11 ‘close to noon’, 12 ‘middle of the day’, 12&ndash;1 p. m.
(Ar.), 1&ndash;3 ‘mid-descent’, 3 ‘the time of the long sinking’, 4 (Ar.)
afternoon, 5.<sub>30</sub> ‘time of twilight’, 6 (Ar.) sunset, 8 (Ar.) evening<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>.
The Javanese speak of morning, forenoon, noon, afternoon,
fall of the day, sunset, evening<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>. The Achenese of Sumatra,
who have a fully developed calendar influenced by Arabic,
keep the old names for the times of day but with Arabic words
and the Moslem hours of prayer intermingled. About 6 a. m.
= with the breaking forth of the sun; 7&ndash;7.<sub>30</sub> = the sun a pole
high, referring to the poles used in propelling craft; 9 = rice
time, i. e. meal time; 10 = the loosening of the ploughing-gear;
11 = the approaching of the zenith; 12 = the zenith; 12.<sub>30</sub> = the falling
from the zenith; 1.<sub>30</sub>&ndash;2 = the middle of the period devoted to
obligatory noon-day prayers; 3 = the last part of this; 3.<sub>30</sub> = the
beginning, 4.<sub>30</sub>&ndash;5 = the middle, and 5.<sub>30</sub> = the last part of the
time of afternoon prayers; 6 = sunset; 7.<sub>30</sub> = evening, especially
referring to the time of commencement of the evening prayer;
then come midnight and the last third of night, 3 a. m. = the
single crowing of the cock, 4&ndash;4.<sub>30</sub> = the continuous crowing of
the cocks, nearly 5 = the streaks of dawn<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>. For the Malays
of the Peninsula the following list is given:&mdash;just before dawn
= before the flies are astir; after sunrise = the heat begins; about
8 a. m. = when the dew dries up; about 9 = when the sun is
half-way above. Then follow:&mdash;when the plough rests; noon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
= just noon, right in the middle, when the shadows are round;
afternoon = when the day turns back; about 1.<sub>30</sub> p. m. = after
(Friday) prayer; about 3 = when the buffaloes go to water;
about 10 = when the children have gone to sleep<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>.</p>

<p>The natives of the Solomon Islands have a rich terminology.
In Buin the following degrees of brightness in the daylight
are distinguished:&mdash;4 a. m., ‘it gradually begins to get light’;
5, ‘the brightness is coming on’; 6, ‘the sun shews himself’; 7,
‘it is getting sun’, ‘the sun is there’; 10, ‘the sun is over the
side-rafters of the roof’ (i. e. not yet quite overhead); 12 noon,
‘the sun has come overhead’; 2 p. m., ‘with westerly inclination’,
‘turning’; 3.30, ‘it has come to the tying of the knot’ (on
the Gazelle Peninsula they say of this time ‘the sun has sat
down to glow’); 5, ‘darkness is drawing near’; 6, ‘it has begun
to get dark’; 7, ‘it has grown dark’<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>. Moreover there are words
and expressions which mean ‘middle of the heavens’, ‘the sun
is over the ridge’, ‘the sun stands below 70° from the horizon’,
‘the sun is on the entrance-beam’<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>. A feature of special note
here is that the houses (which must all be built facing the same
direction) and their parts serve as aids in indicating time. The
inhabitants of New Britain (Bismarck Archipelago) divided up
the day according to the position of the sun, and had words
for sunrise, noon, afternoon, the time of the declining sun, nearly
sunset, sunset, and presumably some others<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>.</p>

<p>The Polynesians mingle the time-indications based on the
position of the sun with others which are derived from the
life of men and nature. We are told that the Hawaiian day
was divided into three general parts, 1, breaking the shadows, 2,
the plain, full day, 3, the decline of the day. But this must
be completed by what follows:&mdash;The lapse of night, however,
was noted by five stations: 1, about sunset; 2, between sunset
and midnight; 3, midnight; 4, between midnight and sunrise; 5,
sunrise<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>. A native Hawaiian writes:&mdash;“When the stars fade
away and disappear, it is <i>ao</i>, daylight; when the sun rises,
day has come, <i>la</i>; when the sun becomes warm, morning is
past; when the sun is directly overhead it is <i>awahea</i>, noon;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
when the sun inclines to the west in the afternoon, the expression
is <i>wa ani ka la</i>. After that come evening, <i>ahi-ahi</i>
(<i>ahi</i>, fire), and then sunset, <i>napoo ka la</i>, and then comes
<i>po</i>, the night, and the stars shine out”. Other expressions are
translated:&mdash;‘there comes a glimmer of colour on the mountains’,
‘the curtains of night are parted’, ‘the mountains light up’, ‘day
breaks’, ‘the east blooms with yellow’, ‘it is broad daylight’<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>.</p>

<p>These are, poetically regarded, very fine examples of
the rich terminology for the time of transition between night
and day. In Tahiti the day has six divisions which are fairly
accurately determined by the height of the sun. Names are
given for midnight, midnight to daybreak, daybreak, sunrise,
the time when the sun begins to be hot, when it reaches the
meridian, evening before sunset, the time after sunset<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>. The
names for the times of day among the Society Islanders were
particularly well developed. For the day there were two expressions
according to its extension either from morning to
evening twilight or from the rising to the setting of the sun.
No division into regular periods was known, nor any means of
establishing these; nevertheless the islanders distinguished a
varying number of points of time, according to recurring physical
changes, at unequal distances from each other. Thus:&mdash;the
time of cock-crow, the first breaking of clouds, twilight, the
stirring of the flies, the time at which a man’s face can be
recognised, daylight, the dipping forward of the sun’s edge,
sunrise, the sun above the horizon, the rays broadening over
the land, the rays falling on the crown of the head, the same
a little oblique, the shadow as long as the object, the same
longer than the man, the sun near the horizon, sunset, the
time at which the houses are lit up, twilight, night, midnight<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>.
For the Marquesas are given:&mdash;daybreak, twilight, dawn,
(‘the day or the red sky, the fleeing night’), broad day&mdash;bright
day from full morning to about ten o’clock&mdash;, noon (‘belly of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
sun’), afternoon (‘back part of the sun’), evening (‘fire-fire’, the
same expression as in Hawaii, i. e. the time to light the fires
on the mountains or the kitchen fire for supper)<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>. The Samoans
divided the day into first dawn, dawn, cock-crowing, day-break,
the time when the bird <i>iao</i> was heard (<i>i</i> = call, <i>ao</i> = day-break),
morning, the time to feed the tame pigeons (about
9 a. m.), the sun upright (= noon), half-way down (about 3
p. m.), sunset. After that the night was divided into:&mdash;the
crying of the cricket (about 20 minutes after sunset), fire-lighting
(about half-an-hour later), the extinguishing of the
lights (about 9 p. m.), midnight, and <i>tulna o pa ma ao</i>, ‘the
standing together of night and day’<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>.</p>

<p>Indications of this nature are convenient only in countries
in which the sun is neither too often nor too long hidden by
clouds. When the sun is hidden the inhabitants have to manage
as best they can. A very interesting statement in this
connection is made by a Swahili native. In rainy days his
tribe observed the crowing of the cock. At the first cock-crow
they knew that it was 5 or 6 a. m.; when the cock
failed to crow all sense of a division of time was lost to them<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>.</p>

<p>The phenomena of Nature afford little basis for the
naming of the times of day, since there is hardly one of them
which recurs regularly every day at a definite time, with the
exception of cock-crow, which is in great favour as an indication
of the time before sunrise. Other exceptional cases
are such names as that mentioned for the Society Islands,
‘the stirring of the flies’; one given for the Mahakam Kayan
of Borneo, <i>tiling</i> (a cricket which is only to be heard at sunset)
<i>duan</i> (to sing)<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>; a couple of expressions of the Wadschagga,
‘the cry of the partridge’ in the evening, ‘the turning of the
smoke down the mountain’<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>; and one of the Nandi, ‘the elephants
have gone to water’<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>. But a people which devotes
itself to cattle-rearing or to agriculture may borrow from its
regular daily occupations expressions for the times of day.
Thus the Mahakam Kayan, besides the above-mentioned name<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
for late afternoon and the term for noon (<i>beluwa dow</i>, ‘half-day’),
have an expression for about 4 p. m.&mdash;<i>dow uli</i>, i. e.
‘the time of the home-coming from work in the fields’. The
Javanese are strongly influenced by civilisation and have,
especially for astrological purposes, a fully developed chronological
system; not seldom, however, the times of day are given
in relation to the rural labour. So they say ‘when the buffalo
is sent to the pastures’, ‘when the buffalo is brought back
from the pastures’ or ‘is housed’ etc.; but for the time of the
occurrence of any event the position of the sun is usually
indicated<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>. The Achenese and the Malays of Sumatra have
an expression exactly corresponding to the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βουλυτός</span><a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>.
The Wadschagga have expressions for the position of the sun,
but also others<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>, among which may be mentioned ‘the first
going of the oxen to the pastures in the morning’. This kind
of terminology seems to have been developed into a system
among the Banyankole, a cattle-raising tribe of the Uganda
Protectorate. The day is divided up in the following way:&mdash;6
a. m., milking-time; 9 a. m., <i>katamyabosi</i>, not translated; 12
noon, rest for the cattle; 1 p. m., the time to draw water; 2
p. m., the time for the cattle to drink; 3 p. m., the cattle leave
the watering-place to graze; 4 p. m., the sun shews signs of
setting; 5 p. m., the cattle return home; 6 p. m., the cattle
enter the kraal; 7 p. m., milking-time<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>. This terminology is
of especial interest since it remains in various Indo-European
languages as a relic of antiquity, and affords a hitherto little
observed piece of evidence for the life of antiquity which
agrees well with others. Compare Sanskrit <i>sagavás</i>, the time
when the cows are herded together; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βουλυτός</span>, the time when
the oxen were unyoked in the Homeric phrase <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἦμος δ’ ἠέλιος
μετενίσσετο βουλυτόνδε</span><a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>; and Irish <i>im-buarach</i>, morning, ‘at the
yoking of the oxen’. With rest or meal-times are associated
Old High German <i>untorn</i>, ‘noon’, the time of the mid-day rest,
Sanskrit <i>abhipitvam</i>, ‘evening’, and Lithuanian <i>piëtus</i>, ‘noon’,
which goes back to Sanskrit <i>pitus</i>, ‘meal-time’<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>Time-indications of various kinds are, as we have seen,
used alongside of one another; when they are fully employed
a very highly organised terminology for the times of
day may be arrived at. The names for the times of day
among the Nandi seem almost artificial:&mdash;2 a. m., the elephants
have gone to the waters; 3, the waters roar; 4, the land (sky)
has become light; 5, the houses are opened; 5.<sub>30</sub>, the oxen
have gone to the grazing-ground; 6, the sheep have been
unfastened; 6.<sub>30</sub>, the sun has grown; 7, it has become warm;
7.<sub>30</sub>, the goats have gone to the grazing-ground; 9, the goats
have returned from the grazing-ground; 9.<sub>30</sub>, the goats sleep
in the kraal; 10, the goats have arisen, the oxen have returned;
10.<sub>30</sub>, the oxen sleep; 11, untie the cattle, i. e. let the
calves get their food, the goats feed; 11.<sub>30</sub>, the oxen have
arisen; 12 noon, the sun has stood upright, the goats sleep
in the wood; 12.<sub>30</sub>, the goats have drunk water; 1 p. m., the
sun turns, i. e. goes towards the west, the cattle have drunk
water; 1.<sub>30</sub>, the drones hum; 2, the sun continues to go towards
the west, the oxen feed; 3, the goats have been collected;
4, the oxen drink water for the second time, the goats have
returned; 4.<sub>30</sub>, the goats sleep; 5, the eleusine grain has been
cleaned for us, take the goats home, shut up the calves; 5.<sub>30</sub>,
the goats have entered the kraal; 6, the sun is finished, the
cattle have returned; 6.<sub>15</sub>, milk (sc. the cows); 6.<sub>45</sub>, neither
man nor tree is recognisable, cattle-fold doors have been
closed; 7, the heavens are fastened; 8, the porridge is finished;
9, those who have drunk milk are asleep; 10, the houses have
been closed; 11, those who sleep early wake up; 12, the middle
of the night<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>.</p>

<p>As a last example I give the most detailed list of all,
from the neighbourhood of Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar.
The times given are naturally to be taken on the
average. 12 midnight, centre of night or halving of night; 2
a. m., frog-croaking; 3, cock-crowing; 4, morning also night;
5, crow-croaking; 5.<sub>15</sub>, bright horizon, glimmer of day, reddish
east; 5.<sub>30</sub>, the colours of cattle can be seen, dusk, diligent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
people awake, early morning; 6, sunrise, day-break, broad
daylight; 6.<sub>15</sub>, dew falls, the cattle go out; 6.30, the leaves are
dry (i. e. the dew disappears); 6.<sub>45</sub>, the hoar-frost disappears,
the day chills the mouth (this applies only to the two or three
winter months); 8, advance of the day; 9, (the sun is) over
(at a right angle with) the purlin; 12 noon, over the ridge of
the roof.&mdash;In the forenoon the position of the sun nearly
square with the eastern purlin of the roof marked about 9
o’clock; and as noon approached, its vertical position about
the ridge-pole, or at least its reaching the meridian, clearly
indicated 12 o’clock. In regard to the terms for the afternoon
we must bear in mind that the houses in former times were
always built with their length running north and south and with
the single door and window facing the west; the sunlight
coming in after midday at the open door by its gradual progress
along the floor gave a fairly accurate measure of time.
The house therefore served, as among the Dyaks, as a kind
of sun-dial.&mdash;12.<sub>30</sub> p. m., day taking hold of the threshold;
1, peeping in of the day (into the room), day less one step;
1.<sub>30</sub>&mdash;2, slipping of the day, decline of the day, afternoon; 2,
(the sun) at the rice-pounding place (i. e. the sunbeam falls on
the rice mortar), at the house-post (there were in the house
three posts supporting the ridge: in the southern one there
were notches, <i>jinja andry</i>, from which the advance of the sunlight
and of the day was observed); 3, at the place of tying
the calf (as the rays reached the one of the posts to which
the calf was tied at night); 4, at the sheep- or poultry-pen;
4.<sub>30</sub>, the cow newly calved comes home; 5, the sun touching
(i. e. when the declining sunshine reached the eastern wall
of the house); 5.<sub>30</sub>, the cattle come home; 5.<sub>45</sub> sunset flush;
6, sunset (lit. ‘sun dead’); 6.<sub>15</sub>, the fowls come in; 6.<sub>30</sub>, dusk,
twilight; 6.<sub>45</sub>, the edge of the rice-cooking pan is obscure; 7,
people begin to cook rice; 8, people eat rice; 8.<sub>30</sub>, finished
eating; 9, people go to sleep; 9.<sub>30</sub>, everyone in bed; 10 gun-fire;
12, midnight<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>.</p>

<p>Finally I collect the Homeric expressions for the parts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
of the day. They are far from being so elaborately organised
as the examples quoted above, and many are incidental periphrases;
the terminology is still at its beginnings. Its character
is quite primitive also in the juxtaposition of terms of different
kinds. The day is divided into the familiar three parts. ‘It
will be a dawn, or an afternoon, or a noon when I am to be
killed’, says Achilles<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>. The meaning of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἠώς</span>, ‘dawn’, is also
extended so that the word can denote forenoon or at least
morning. Cp. the following phrases:&mdash;‘I slept the whole night
and to the dawn and to the noon’,<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> ‘as long as it was dawn
and the holy day increased’<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>; of this the phrase already
quoted, ‘as the sun turned over to the unyoking of the oxen’,
is the counterpart. In this sense appears also the derivative
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἠοίη</span>. When Menelaus wishes to surprise the Old Man of the
Sea he goes to the seashore ‘as the dawn appeared’<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>: the Old
Man is said to come ‘as the sun ascends the middle of the
heavens’<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>. Thus ‘we waited the whole dawn’ until ‘the Old
Man came up from the sea at noon’<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>. The afternoon, in which
the suitors amuse themselves with dance and song, is also
called eventide<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>; when evening, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἕσπερος</span>, comes, they go home
to sleep<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>. Besides these larger divisions smaller ones were
also indicated, e. g. the morning twilight, ‘when it was not yet
dawn but still the twilight of the ending night’<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>. Before dawn
there appears the morning star, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑωσφόρος</span>, Il. XXIII, 226, Od. XIII,
93. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἠώς</span>, ‘dawn’ in the proper sense of the word, is often used
as a time-indication, sometimes in the well-known periphrastic
expressions of Il. XI, 1, XIX, 1, Od. V, 1. XXIII, 347, XXII, 197,
sometimes alone, e. g. ‘at dawn’, ‘at the appearance of dawn’<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>.
Sunrise is always indicated by verbal and often periphrastic
expressions, simply by <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνιέναι</span>, ‘rise’<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>, further ‘the sun, leaving
the fair sea, rose into the all-brazen heaven to shine for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
immortal ones’ etc.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>, and ‘neither as he ascends to the starry
heaven nor as he again turns back to the earth from the
heavens’<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>, similarly Od. XII, 380 ff., Il. XI, 735 ‘as long as the
shining sun rose above the earth’<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>, and Il. VII, 421 ff. ‘the sun
thereafter once more struck the fields, ascending in the heavens
from the deep and soft-flowing ocean’<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>. The expression can
therefore also include the time immediately following after
sunrise, but is not applied to the whole period of the sun’s
ascension, i. e. the forenoon. The culmination of the sun is
mentioned in Od. IV, 400 (cp. above) and in Il. VIII, 68.
The decline of the day is thus described, ‘the day was for the
greater part gone’<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>; for the sinking of the sun see Od. XI,
18, XII, 381 (cp. above), and the already quoted expression
‘the sun turned over to the unyoking of the oxen’. Sunset (Il.
XVII, 454, XVIII, 241, Od. II, 388) is described by the common
word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δύνειν</span>, ‘set’, or by ‘goes under the earth’<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>, or ‘the bright
light of the sun sank down in the ocean, drawing after himself
the dark night’<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>. The evening star has the same name as
evening, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἕσπερος</span><a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>. The Homeric Greeks therefore do not seem
to have observed the position of the sun in any but the most
general fashion. We may add certain indications taken from
the business of daily life. The word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βουλυτός</span> (cp. above p. 31)
appears in the twice-recurring verse ‘as the sun turned over
to the unyoking of the oxen’<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>. It is not the sun but the ploughman
that unyokes the oxen: the word has therefore become established
as a chronological <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terminus technicus</i> which is significant on
account of its antiquity. About the expression <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐν νυκτὸς ἀμολγῷ</span>
there has been much dispute. It occurs:&mdash;Il. XI, 173 and XV,
324, where lions surprise a herd, XXII, 28, in the simile of the
morning rising of Sirius, 317, of the shining forth of the evening<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
star, Od. IV, 841 ‘so clear appeared the dream to her’<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>: it is
a well-known fact that we dream for the most part shortly
before waking. The sense ‘beginning or end of night’ is
therefore fully confirmed. As for the etymology I do not hesitate
to pronounce in favour of that lying nearest to hand, viz.
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμέλγειν</span>, ‘to milk’, and therefore ‘milking-time’. Compare the
terms of the Banyankole for early morning at 6 o’clock and
evening at 7&mdash;‘milking-time’&mdash;and those of the Nandi: 6 p. m.
‘the sun is over, the cattle have come back’; 6.<sub>15</sub>, ‘milk’ (sc.
the cows). That only these two expressions have settled into
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">termini technici</i> admits of a not unimportant conclusion in
regard to antiquity. The meal-hour as an indication of time
occurs Il. XI, 86, ‘when a wood-cutter prepares his meal after
having fatigued his arms by felling large trees’<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>, and Od. XII,
439, ‘when a man rises from the market-place to go home to
the meal after having judged many quarrels’<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>,&mdash;in the latter
instance in connexion with the market. This time-indication
was destined to have a great future as the social life of the
Greeks developed. Phrases such as the following are of common
occurrence:&mdash;‘when the market-place is full’<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>, ‘before the market-place
has filled itself’<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>, ‘the breaking up of the assembly of
the market-place’<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>, etc. The night was divided into the familiar
three parts (although the expression <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέση νύξ</span>, ‘middle of the
night’, first occurs in the smaller Iliad) and was judged according
to the position of the stars:&mdash;‘Let us go, for the night
draws close to an end and the dawn is near. The stars are
far gone. The greater part of night is gone, the two parts, only
the third part remains’<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>; ‘when it was the third part of the
night and the stars had passed’<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>. The morning star serves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
as a time-indicator at the nocturnal home-coming of Odysseus<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>.</p>

<p>The Latin expressions I merely copy from Censorinus,
Ch. 24, and insert in brackets the additions made by Macrob.,
<cite>Sat.</cite> I, 3, 16 ff. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tempus quod huic</i>&mdash;i. e. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nox media&mdash;proximum
est vocatur de media nocte (media noctis inclinatio), sequitur

conticuerunt; tunc ante lucem, et sic diluculum, cum sole nondum
orto iam lucet. Secundum diluculum vocatur mane cum lux videtur
sole orto, post hoc ad meridiem, tunc meridies, quod est
medii diei nomen, inde de meridie (inde&mdash;i. e. a meridie&mdash;tempus

sequitur vespera ante ortum scilicet</i>&mdash;this must be before the
appearance of the star&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eius stellae, quam Plautus vesperuginem
... appellat</i>. There are also <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ortus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">occasus solis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crepusculum</i>.
This terminology is poor and applies almost exclusively
to the daylight. In ancient Rome the edifices of the Forum
are said to have served as sun-dials. A servant of the consul proclaimed
noon “when the sun peeped between the Rostra and the
Graecostasis; when the sun sank from the Maenian column to
the prison he proclaimed evening, but only on clear days”<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>.
With the advance of civilisation the Greek terms for the twelve
hours of the day, each of which varied in length according to
the time of the year, became customary, a fact which is connected
with the spread of sun- and water-clocks<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>. Hence arises in
the Middle Ages the terminology derived from the daily mass
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hora canonica</i>)<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>. In daily life there was often a recurrence
to primitive methods. I borrow a few examples of a quite
primitive character from the early medieval tract <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Peregrinatio
Aetheriae</i>:&mdash;‘the hour when people can recognise each other’<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
‘when the crow of cocks begins’<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>, ‘from the first cock-crow’<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>,
etc., but also <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hora tertia</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quinta</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sexta</i> (noon).</p>

<p>An obviously isolated method is the determination of the
times of day from the daily twice-recurring ebb and flow of
the tides; the method is also very unsuitable, since the period
of a complete tide is 12 hours 25 minutes, so that the two
periods together exceed the day by nearly an hour. In fact the
Eskimos of Greenland are the only people who reckon by the
tides. They divide up the day according to ebb and flow, although
they must always reckon differently on account of the variations
of the moon<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>. Dalsager<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> also points this out and remarks
that their reckoning cannot last for two consecutive days, so
that they have to make a fresh division every day. The rudiments
of this method are however seen among some of the
tribes of Polynesia. Immediately after the above-quoted divisions
of the day among the Society Islanders are mentioned “the
longer periods before noon and midnight during which the sea
rises, and the others following these, in which it falls”<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>, and
“night or the light quite gone, when the sea begins to flow
towards the land, about 11 at night”<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>. The Hawaiians called
the rising of the tide by such names as the rising, big, full,
and surrounding sea; when the water neither rose nor fell it
was called the standing sea; the ebbing sea they spoke of as
the parted, retiring, and defeated sea<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>.</p>

<p>The night is the time of complete darkness and rest,
and therefore the frequently mentioned expression, ‘sleeping-time’,
corresponds to night. Seldom is the whole time during
which the sun remains below the horizon to be understood
by it. On the Society Islands there were two expressions for
day according to its extension from morning to evening twilight
or from sunrise to sunset<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>. The Hawaiian judge, Fornander,
follows this mode of speech when he distinguishes five periods
of night, (1) about sunset, (2) between sunset and midnight, (3)
midnight, (4) between midnight and sunrise, and (5) sunrise<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>.
For the times between sunset and night-fall and between night<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
and sunrise there is a rich terminology which has already
been illustrated. During the night itself time-indications are
for obvious reasons scanty. Often the only point distinguished
is midnight, e. g. by the Kiowa<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>, the Masai<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>, the Shilluk<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>;
‘the silence of the land’ among the Babwende<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>, ‘the back of
night’ among the Hottentots<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>, ‘the time of sleep’ among the
Hawaiians<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>. Hence arises of itself a threefold division in
which the periods of night before and after midnight are distinguished,
as e. g. by the Hawaiians<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>. The usual method is to
start from the day, i. e. the limit of the day, and then to proceed
on both sides in the direction of midnight, as in the late
evening of the Hottentots, which extends till long after sunset<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>,
and the ‘not yet early’ and the <i>tara</i> (beginning at dusk and
extending till the time of rest) among the Masai<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>, etc. The
Tahitians are credited with six divisions of the day and as
many of the night, this more accurate division of night being
of course determined by the stars<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>; the only expressions reported
however are those for midnight and the time from midnight
to daybreak<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>. On the Marquesas Islands the first night-watch
was ‘the hour of ghosts’; the advanced night was termed
‘black night’, and midnight ‘great sleep’; the last watch of
night was ‘the coming of day’<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>. The Wadschagga have three
night watches:&mdash;the awakening in the evening, that in the middle
(midnight), and that in the morning twilight<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>. The Javanese
have night, midnight, and waning of night<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>. Where the cock
is kept, its crow serves as a sign that the night is drawing
to an end, as for instance among the Swahili<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>, and in the
Dutch Indies<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>; the Yoruba distinguish other cock-crowings, such
as ‘the cock opening the way’, i. e. the first cock-crowing, ‘the
time of the cock-crowing immediately before sunset’<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>. Quite
exceptional however is the device ascribed to the inhabitants
of the New Hebrides. In order to denote the hours of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
night they make a gesture in the direction of the spot where
the sun would be at the corresponding hour of day<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>.</p>

<p>There is only one means of accurately indicating the
times of night, and that is by the observation of the stars.
Many peoples judge from the position of the morning-star the
time that has yet to elapse before sunrise: but this cannot
always be done, and in any case the method is only of
use in the early morning. But the fixed stars are always
there. The difficulty however arises that every day the stars
gain about four minutes on the sun; the stars must therefore
be accurately known, and the observer must either be acquainted
with their positions at definite times of the year or else
be constantly choosing a new star as his chronometer. Not
many peoples have got so far as that. Although the science
of astronomy was very well developed among the Polynesians,
we are told of the Tahitians that to distinguish the hours of
night by means of the stars was a science with which very
few of them were acquainted<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>. On the Society Islands the
advance of night was determined from the stars<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>; and so
in Hawaii, with as great accuracy as the hours of the day
from the sun<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>. “When the Milky Way passes the meridian
and inclines to the west, people (in Hawaii) say ‘the fish has
turned’”<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>. Among the Indians of South America the knowledge
of the stars is very wide-spread. E. Nordenskjöld, who
visited the border districts where Brazil, Bolivia, and the Argentine
meet, says repeatedly that the stellar heavens are the
Indian’s clock and compass. When sitting in their huts they
can, without looking out, indicate the positions of the more
important constellations in the sky. If one is out with an
Indian at night he will point to Orion or some other constellation
and shew how far it will have moved on before the end
of the journey is reached<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>. The Eskimos of Greenland, when
it is dark, indicate the time from <i>nelarsik</i> (Vega)<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>, or from
the Pleiades<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>. Among them the observation of the stars is
uncommonly well developed. The Lapps, who have to tend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
their reindeer during the long winter nights, determine the
course of time by certain stars. <i>Sarvon</i> is the largest star in
the heavens: when in winter it stands in the middle of the
sky it marks midnight; it is called the night-clock of the Lapps.
The Great Dog, the Old Man, and the Old Woman are three
stars that pursue <i>sarva</i>. They rise when the people go to
sleep, and set a little before daybreak. They ascend the heavens
obliquely in front of <i>sarva</i>, in the morning they dip downwards.
Another authority states that <i>sarva</i> is the Great Bear;
the first couple of stars in it are the Old Man and the Old
Woman, the second the Dog and the Elk. The reindeer herdsman
decides from it how far night is advanced, and when he
may expect to be relieved. <i>Lovosj</i> or <i>suttjenes</i> is the name
given to the Pleiades. The constellation indicates midnight,
when the weather is good. A fable tells how this constellation
saved a servant who had been driven out by his master
into the great cold of a winter night. The young men wish
the maidens to tend the reindeer by night and say:&mdash;“Go
and kiss the <i>suttjenes</i> young men”, but the maidens answer:&mdash;“Go
yourselves and kiss the <i>suttjenes</i> maidens”<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>. Of the old
Icelanders Kålund writes:&mdash;“At night the moon and certain
stars, especially the Pleiades, afford them the same aid” (i. e.
as the signs of day)<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>. The Homeric Greeks&mdash;at least in a
general fashion&mdash;also judged of the advance of night by the
position of the stars<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>. This more accurate method is therefore
peculiar to a few primitive peoples specially gifted in
astronomy.</p>

<p>From the investigation of the modes of naming and reckoning
the day and its parts it follows for primitive time-reckoning
in general that the time-indications refer to concrete
phenomena, and therefore either they indicate a point of time
or, if they are related to periods, these periods are of different
and fluctuating length. They are accordingly of no use in
calculating, they cannot simply be added together even when
a number of such periods together make up the period of a
complete day, i. e. they are fundamentally discontinuous. When
several days are to be counted the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pars pro toto</i> method is used:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
instead of the whole day a part is counted. Within the day
two phenomena chiefly recur with such unfailing constancy as
to be of use in counting: they are the daily reviving sun and
the night or sleeping-time. The word for sun is often the same
as that for day. Within the day fall a number of occupations
which chiefly turn the attention to its length and varying
phenomena, and this is the case also with the sun itself, for
the varying position of the sun in the heavens affords the
most usual mode of indicating the time of day. For the counting
a point of time is best suited, or, which comes to the
same thing, a unit without subdivisions, a blank period. This
is the reason why the counting by ‘sleeps’ or nights predominates.
On the same grounds the quite isolated <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pars pro toto</i>
counting of the days from the dawns in Homer may be explained.
To indicate the duration of time primitive peoples
make use of other means, derived from their daily business,
which have nothing to do with time-reckoning; in Madagascar
‘rice-cooking’ often means half an hour, ‘the frying of a locust’
a moment<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>. The Cross River natives say:&mdash;‘The man died
in less than the time in which maize is not yet completely
roasted’, i. e. less than about 15 minutes; ‘the time in which
one can cook a handful of vegetables’, i. e. an hour<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>. The
Malays, the Javanese, and the Achenese use the following expressions
for a period of time:&mdash;a blink of the eyes (literally),
the time required for chewing a quid of <i>sirih</i> (about 5 minutes),
the time required for cooking a <i>kay</i> of rice (about half
an hour), for cooking a <i>gantang</i> of rice (about an hour and
a half), half a day, a ‘sun-dark’, i. e. a complete day and night<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>.
The natives of New Britain (Bismarck Archipelago) measure
the time between sunset and the moon-rise by the smouldering
of a torch or the time occupied in cooking yams, taro, or
wild taro. Short divisions of time were also expressed by
comparative terms, e. g. the throwing of a stick for a short
distance, ‘a woman’s crossing’, or the distance a woman would
paddle<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>. Very often duration of time is indicated by reference
to the time needed to traverse a well-known piece of road<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
between two places. Examples are superfluous. But all these
indications of periods of time are found among more developed
peoples: the primitive peoples pay little or no attention to
them.</p>

<p>Both in the case of the day and in that of the other
time-units this clinging to a natural basis long proved a hindrance
to a rational system of time-reckoning, which could only
be achieved by breaking away from natural phenomena. For
there are no fixed natural limits of day, but if morning and
evening, or still more clearly sunrise and sunset, are chosen
as the limits, these must change every day and the days will
vary in length. Here the midnight period proved of assistance,
since it facilitated the establishing of a fixed point of divergence.
This was done in Rome, and the practice had its root
in daily life, where in order to indicate the time of occurrence
of events which took place in the night-time the calculation
was pushed forwards on both sides towards midnight, until
this became the limit of divergence. It is however an artificial
epoch that must be found by calculation<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>.</p>

<p>In the second place the hour of antiquity is a twelfth part
of the whole time of daylight, and this duodecimal division was
also transferred to the night, which had commonly been divided
into four watches according to the practice borrowed from
military life. This hour therefore varied in length according to
the time of the year. The inconvenience of a varying division
of this nature must have made itself felt in daily life, although
in the south it was not so insupportable as it must have been
in the north. It rendered the construction of the clock difficult,
and above all was impracticable for scientific astronomy.
Hence alongside of it appeared even in antiquity the hour of
constant length or the double hour, viz. a twelfth or a twenty-fourth
part respectively of the complete day. The double hour,
notwithstanding Bilfinger’s assertion to the contrary, arose in
Babylon (<i>kasbu</i>), and is connected with the duodecimal division
of the zodiac<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>. This hour of constant length was not generally
adopted until very late: the varying hour remained almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
up to the end of the Middle Ages. Our modern hour
has only been in general use since about the 14th century,
when it was first spread by the construction of the striking-clock<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>.
Its convenience for the business of practical life and
the construction of the clock together secured the victory of
the hour as 1/24th of the day, originally a numerical and
astronomical division. A condition for its use was the fusion
of day and night into one unit, since as long as these were
kept separate the constant hour could not thrive. Both the
complete day and its regular divisions however only won their
way after a very long time, because men were unwilling to
depart from the natural basis in time-reckoning. The substitution
of the artificial for the natural time-reckoning has also,
as far as the day is concerned, created a rational system of
reckoning which has borrowed from the natural system only
one feature, viz. the average length of the complete day.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE SEASONS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy1">The year is for us a numerical quantity of 365 or 366
days. But we speak of the year in two senses, first as the
calendar year beginning on New Year’s Day, and secondly
as the current year, a period of the same number of days
beginning at one chosen day, as for instance in giving a
person’s age. The word ‘year’ may however also represent
the highest chronological unit even independently of the seasons,
as in the case of the Egyptian shifting year of exactly 365
days, and the Islamite lunar year of 354. These however are
exceptional cases. At the basis lies the natural year conditioned
by the course of the sun and by the natural phases dependent
thereon, which penetrate closely into the life of man.
This connexion has necessitated the agreement of the numerical
year with the sun, whence arises a situation very inconvenient
for reckoning, namely that years of a varying number
of days have to be accepted, since the natural year does not
contain a whole number of days.</p>

<p>The year as a numerical quantity is only the tardily attained
summit of development, and the connexion with the
natural year has always been so strongly felt that, except in
certain cases such as the Egyptian and Islamite years, the
chronological year has had to adjust itself accordingly. Here
also we see the point of departure, the natural phenomena
which are in the end dependent upon the course of the sun,
such as the variation between heat and cold, verdure and snow,
rainy season and drought, the blooming and withering of vegetation,
between the different trade-winds or monsoons, between
abundance and scarcity of food. With these and similar concrete<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
phenomena the time-reckoning is from its origin bound
up, and is at first discontinuous, i. e. it fixes the attention solely
on the phenomena in question, and not on the year as a whole.
The fusion of the various seasons into the circle of the year
is arrived at only by degrees: the year is at first counted by
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pars pro toto</i> method. The process is therefore similar
to that already found in the discussion of the day.</p>

<p>It must be granted as a premise to our investigation that
when we speak of ‘seasons’ not only the larger divisions of
the year are to be understood by the word&mdash;those which
alone of all the natural epochs of the year are current among
us to-day&mdash;but also smaller divisions which might perhaps
be called seasonal points; for instance the times of cherry-blossoming
and hop-picking are also seasons. Such short&mdash;often
very short&mdash;seasons are not distinguished in any important
feature from the longer: the difference only arises
from the longer or shorter duration of the phenomena in question.
The Hidatsa Indians describe any period thus marked by a
natural occurrence, be it long or short, the hot season or the
season of strawberries, by the same word, <i>kadu</i>, ‘season’,
‘time’ (of the occurrence), and the longer seasons include
shorter<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>.</p>

<p>We begin with these shorter seasons since they are more
foreign to us: to primitive man however they are of extreme
importance, since in the absence of a regular calendar they
afford the only means he knows of determining the shortest
periods of the natural year, in so far as they are connected
with this. A time-determination of this nature is important not
so much for giving the date of any occurrence as for establishing
beforehand the time of certain occupations, e. g. sowing
or a festival.</p>

<p>The classical instance is afforded by the peasants’ maxims
of Hesiod. The cry of the migrating cranes shews the time
of ploughing and sowing<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>. If one sows too late, the crop may
still thrive if Zeus sends rain upon it on the third day after
the cuckoo has called for the first time in the leaves of the oak<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
(486). Before the appearance of the swallow, the messenger of
spring, the vines should be pruned (568). But when the snail
climbs up the plants there should be no more digging in the
vineyards (571). When the thistle blossoms and the shrill note
of the cicada is to be heard, summer has come, the goats are
at their fattest, and the wine is at its best (582). The sea can be
navigated when the fig-tree shews at the end of its branches
leaves which are as big as the foot-prints of the crow (679).
Especially well-known and beloved as a sign that the hard winter
was over was the swallow: evidence is afforded by the famous
procession of the Rhodian swallow-youths<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>, and by a vase-decoration
clearly expressing the delight felt at the appearance of
the herald of Spring<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>. The observation of the birds of passage
was very useful for this kind of time-determination: Homer
already knows it, ‘when the cranes flee the winter’, he says<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>,
so also Theognis: “I hear, son of Polypais, the voice of the
shrill-crying crane, even her who to mortals comes as harbinger
of the season for ploughing”<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>. Aristophanes makes
his birds boast of it:&mdash;</p>

<p>Similar time-determinations from natural phenomena are
still not entirely neglected by the modern peasant. In Bohuslän
(W. Sweden) the sowing-time was at hand when the
swallow had come, it was the right sowing-time when the
juniper flowered. In northern Scania (S. Sweden) the barley
was to be sown when the hawthorn was in bloom. Older
people could not give their birthdays but only knew that they
were born e. g. at the rye- or potato-harvest, when the cattle
were first driven out to pasture (in the spring), etc. My father
knew quite well that his birthday was the fifth of September,
but when anyone asked him when he was born he would
generally answer: ‘When they pick hops’. The Eskimos said
that such and such a person was born when eggs were collected
or seals caught<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>. From modern Palestine a bond is quoted
in which a sum of money was to be paid when next the <i>fakûs</i>
(a kind of cucumber) was ripe<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>.</p>

<p>We return to the primitive peoples and give first a few
examples in which a natural phenomenon serves as the sign
of the beginning of one of the longer divisions of the year or
of some occupation, generally agriculture. Of the Bushmen
we are told that they paid particular attention to the time at
which the first thunder-storm broke. They hailed it with great
joy since they counted it a sure sign that summer had commenced.
In the midst of their excessive rejoicing they tore
in pieces their garments of skins, threw them into the air,
and danced for several <ins class="corr" id="tn-48" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'nights in sucession'">
nights in succession</ins>. The Garieb Bushmen
made great outcries accompanied with dancing and playing
upon their drums<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>. The Banyankole of Uganda used the
euphorbia trees to guide them as to the nearness of the rainy
season: when these trees began to shoot out new growth
they knew that the rains were near<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>. The Indians of the
Orinoco took great pains to determine the approach of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
rainy season, as Gilij relates in a chapter entitled: <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">De segni,
che precedon l’inverno</cite><a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>. The signs were:&mdash;The scream of the
Araguato monkeys at midnight or at the approach of day;
the sudden bursting into blossom of certain trees; the swelling
of the brooks, which almost dry up in summer but swell a few
days before the rainy season; the yams which in summer have
lost their leaves suddenly grow green again when the rainy
season is at hand; finally the heliacal setting of the Pleiades.
The tribe of the Bigambul in S. E. Australia reckon the seasons
from the blossoming of certain trees. <i>Yerra</i>, for example, is
the name of a tree that blossoms in September: this time of
the year is therefore called <i>yerrabinda</i>. The apple-tree blossoms
at Christmas time, which is called <i>nigabinda</i>. The iron-bark
tree blossoms about the end of January, and this time is
called <i>wobinda</i>. The height of summer however is named by
them ‘the time when the ground burns the feet’: at this time
no trees blossom<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>. The natives of New Britain (Bismarck
Archipelago) determine the planting-season from the buds of
certain trees and from the position of certain stars<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>. In Alu
(Solomon Islands) one division of the year is determined from
the bloom on the almond, another from the Pleiades<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>. The
time for the sun-dance of the Kiowa Indians is determined by
the whitening of the down on the cotton-plant<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>. One of the
annual festivals of the Society Islands is regulated by the
blossoming of the reed<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>.</p>

<p>Instances are numerous in which phenomena like those
mentioned by Hesiod serve as signs for agricultural labour.
The Indians of Pennsylvania say that when the leaf of the
white oak, which comes out in spring, is as large as a mouse’s
ear it is time to plant maize: they note that the whippoorwill
has come by then, and is constantly fluttering round them
calling out his Indian name <i>wekolis</i> in order to remind them
of planting-time, just as if he were saying ‘<i>hacki heck</i>’, ‘go
and plant maize’<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>. Among the Thonga the period in July
when the warm weather begins is called <i>shimunu</i>, ‘the little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
heat’: the mahogany and sala trees become covered with
leaves, certain flowers blossom. Winter has passed away,
soon the summer will come. When the Thonga woman notes
these signs she picks up her hoe and sets off for the hills or
the marshes to make the fields ready. In January comes <i>nwebo</i>,
the time for the first ears of maize to ripen<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>. Among the
Ba-Ronga January is <i>nuebo</i>, the time of the first ripe ears:
great pains are taken to keep away the birds from the <i>sorgho</i>
fields, and therefore one period is known as ‘the time when
the birds are driven away’<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>. When a certain mushroom named
<i>kulat bantilong</i> appears in large quantities the Dyaks of S. E.
Borneo regard it as a sign that the time for rice-planting has
come<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>; among the Malgassi the blossoming of the shrub <i>Vernonia
appendiculata</i> in November is regarded in the same way<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>.
In New Zealand plants and birds which appear at regular
seasons give signs of the approach of the time to begin agricultural
labours. Two kinds of migratory cuckoo, <i>Cuculus
piperatus</i> and <i>nitens</i>, which appear at Christmas-time on the
coasts, mark the period of the first potato-harvest. The flowering
of the beautiful <i>Clematis albida</i> reminds the people to
dig over the soil for the planting of potatoes, which is done
in October<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>. According to the communication of a native,
the Basutos reckon time by the changing of the seasons, the
birth-times of animals, the annual variation and growth of
plants, but also by the stars and the moon<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>. The most curious
method is one common among the Hidatsa Indians, who
reckon from the development of the buffalo calf <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in utero</i><a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>.
Such signs may also serve to mark off the longer seasons:
the Tunguses begin summer with the time when the grayling
spawns, and winter with the time when the first good squirrel
is caught<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>.</p>

<p>The examples hitherto given are only single instances
intended to make clear the manner and signification of this
method of indicating time. Similar starting-points for reckoning
are afforded the whole year through, and as their times are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
fixed in regard to each other, they may form a sort of calendar.
The statements made for the extremely primitive Andamanese
give a very characteristic circle of occupations
throughout the year, though here we have to do not with
names of seasons but with the phenomena and business of the
year, which our authority gives according to the European
calendar. January: much honey; two kinds of wild fruit ripen
and are gathered. February: two other kinds of wild fruit,
also a tuber; the inhabitants of the coastal districts catch the
dujong and also a few turtles; the older folk make out of bark
turtle-nets, cables, and lines for harpoons. March: still another
two kinds of wild fruit ripen, wild honey is abundant. April:
many visits of neighbouring tribes; fruit is scanty, there is
only one kind ripe, the honey is finished, the bread-fruit has
not yet ripened. From May to August the ripe bread-fruit
forms the principal food. In June many cases of death occur
since the men in their boar-hunting expeditions in the forest
sleep without shelter. In August certain white caterpillars
which live in the decaying tree-trunks are a favourite dish.
From August to October boats are built. In November the
people are particularly merry. The turtle-catch is productive,
the weather is pleasantly cool, there is little rain, and shelter
is not necessary. Different tribes visit one another and feast
and dance together<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>.</p>

<p>How upon such a foundation a number of seasons may
be built up is shewn by a comparison with an instructive
account referring to the Eskimos of the Ungava district of
Labrador. The seasons have distinctive names and are again
sub-divided into a great number of shorter seasons. There are
more of these during the warmer weather than in winter. The
reason is obviously that the summer offers so many changes,
and the winter so few. The chief events are the return of
the sun, always a sign of joy to the people, the lengthening
of the day, the warm weather in March when the sun has
attained sufficient height, the melting of the snow, the breaking
up of the ice, the open water, the time of birth of various<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
seals, the advent of exotic birds, the nesting of gulls, eider,
and other native birds, the arrival of white whales and the
whaling season, salmon fishing, the ripening of salmon-berries
and other species of edibles, the time of reindeer crossing
the river, the trapping of fur-bearing animals, and hunting
on land and water for food. Each of these periods has its
special name applied to it, although several may overlap each
other. The appearance of mosquitoes, sandflies, and horseflies
is marked by dates anticipated with considerable apprehension
of annoyance<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>. The Eskimos of Greenland reckon from the
winter solstice five moons until the time when the nights become
so bright that it is impossible to reckon any longer from
the moon. Then they reckon by the increasing size of the
young of the eider-duck and by the ripening of berries, or
along the sea-coast by the departure of the tern and the fatness
of the seals; when the reindeer shed the velvet from their
horns they know that it is time to move into the winter
houses<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>.</p>

<p>These smaller seasons have seldom developed into an
annual cycle otherwise than among some agricultural peoples<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>,
unless they have been fitted into the larger seasons. This is
the case with the western tribes of the Torres Straits, who also
determine the seasons from the stars. In the counting of the
seasons they commonly begin with <i>surlal</i> (mid-October to the end
of November). This name is given to the turtles when copulating:
while in this state they float on the sea and are readily
caught. The constellation known as the Shark arises. Everything
is dried up, the yams are ripe. The sounding of the
first thunder is the sign for planting yams. <i>Raz</i> (December
to February) is described as ‘the time of death’, i. e. the season
when the leaves die down. The first part of this season is
called in Mabuiag <i>duau-urma</i>, ‘the falling of the cashew nuts’.
There is an interval of fine weather and the wind is shifty: this
coincides with Christmas-time. This is the time when the yams
which have been planted begin to sprout. In Muralug this
period is called <i>malgui</i>, which is the exact equivalent of our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
word ‘spring’. The next division is called <i>dob</i>, ‘the last of
growing things’, or <i>kusikuki</i>, ‘medusae of the north-west’, the
latter name being due to the large numbers of jelly-fish that
float on the sea. The runners of the yams now grow. The
time immediately after this is called <i>purimugo</i>, in Muralug
<i>apagap</i> or <i>keme</i>. The longer season following <i>raz</i> is <i>kuki</i>,
(March to May), the time when strong winds blow intermittently
from the north-west, accompanied by deluges of rain, and the
time of the damp heat. The appearance of the constellation
<i>dogai kukilaig</i> (Altair, together with β, γ <i>aquilae</i>) heralded
the beginning of this season. It has the sub-divisions <i>kuki</i>,
<i>kupa kuki</i>, and <i>gugad arai</i>. The dry season, <i>aibaud</i>, forms
the remaining part of the year. The south-west wind, <i>waur</i>,
blows steadily: for this reason the first part of this period is
known as <i>waur</i> and perhaps merits a distinctive name as much
as <i>raz</i>. It is marked by the appearance of the constellation
<i>magi Dogai</i> (Vega with β, γ <i>lyrae</i>). Food is abundant and
festivals are celebrated. The divisions of <i>aibaud</i> are <i>sasiwaur</i>
(‘child’, i. e. lesser south-east), <i>piepe</i>, <i>tati waur</i> (‘father’, i. e.
greater south-east), and <i>birubiru</i>, a bird which at this time
migrates from New Guinea to Australia<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>.</p>

<p>The Kiwai Papuans who dwell on the opposite coast of
New Guinea have the same star myths as the inhabitants
of the Torres Straits Islands: for them, however, no smaller
but only two greater seasons are mentioned<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>; on the other
hand they have months<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>. The smaller seasons have clashed
with the reckoning by moons, and have surrendered their
names to describe the latter. They have therefore in great
measure become merged in the counting of the months, which
will be dealt with later. The greater seasons on the other
hand, on account of their length, could not be merged in the
reckoning by months, and these have therefore everywhere
remained. The number of the longer seasons varies considerably,
and is of course connected not only with the climatic
conditions but also with the fundamental phenomena which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
for one reason or another attract attention; a larger season
may also be divided into two or three smaller ones.</p>

<p>It may be taken for granted that all peoples outside the
tropics, even where it has not been thought necessary expressly
to mention the fact, know the two larger divisions of the year,
the warmer and colder seasons. Where the plants die in winter
and the trees lose their leaves, or where the snow covers the
ground, this great difference becomes especially pronounced
and determines the whole mode of life: but even in the sub-tropical
regions it is obvious enough. To it corresponds in
many parts of the tropics and sub-tropical zones the natural
division into a dry and a rainy season. For the division into
the summer period of vegetation and winter with its snow
and ice it is superfluous to give examples: the above-quoted
description of the year of the Labrador Eskimos is a typical
instance. Swanton and Boas state that certain Indian tribes
of N. W. America divide the year into two equal parts of six
months each, summer extending from April to September, and
winter from October to March<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>. The Comanches reckon by
the cold and the warm seasons<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>. I give a few instances from
districts in which a winter of this nature does not exist. Among
the Hopi of Arizona the year has two divisions&mdash;there seems
to be no equivalent to our four seasons&mdash;which may be
termed the periods of the named and the nameless months:
the former is the cold period, the latter is the warm. They
may also be called the greater and the lesser periods, since
the former begins in August and ends in March<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>. The Zuñi
of western New Mexico also divide the year into two periods
of six months each<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>. The Chocktaw of Louisiana have the
same number of seasons<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>. The natives of Central Australia
have names for summer and winter<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>.</p>

<p>In the tropics there is often only one rainy and one dry
season, with two divisions of the year corresponding to these.
On the Orinoco there are summer and winter, i. e. the dry
and the rainy seasons. In Maipuri the dry season is called
<i>camoti</i>, ‘the glowing splendour of the sun’, and the rainy season<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
<i>canepó</i>. Among the Tamanacho winter is called <i>canepó</i>, ‘rain’,
‘rainy season’, summer is <i>vannu</i>, ‘crickets’, since these insects
chirp incessantly to the end of the season<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>. The Tupi have
expressions for dry and rainy seasons but not for the year as
a whole. The Bakairi reckon by the semesters of the dry
and the rainy seasons<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>. The Karaya of Central Brazil reckon
the year from one fall of the river to another. They thereby
distinguish two seasons, the dry season when they live on
the sand-banks, and the rainy season when they live on the
upper banks of the river<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>. The Wagogo of E. Africa divide
the year into two halves: <i>kibahu</i>, the dry season, about May-October,
and <i>kifugu</i>, the rainy season, November to April<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>.
So also the Nandi: <i>iwotet</i>, rainy season, March-August, and
<i>kement</i>, dry season, September-February<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>; further the tribes
of Loango<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>, the Bantu tribes of the Congo State<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>, and the
Cross River negroes of the Cameroons<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>. The Tshi-speaking
peoples divide the year into two periods: the smaller <i>hohbor</i>,
from May to August, and the larger from September to April<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>.
Among the Akamba the year consists of two rainy seasons
separated by two dry periods: <i>ambua anzwa</i>, <i>ambua ua</i><a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>.
Where this natural division prevails, however, the half-year is
often put in the place of the year<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>.</p>

<p>The Javanese have a dry and a rainy period which include
six of their seasons<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>, and so have the Islamite Malays
of Sumatra<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>. The Polynesians divide the year throughout
into two greater periods. Their seasons were in general two,
the rainy season or winter, and the dry season or summer,
but varied according to the situation of the particular group
of islands north or south of the equator. On the Society Islands
they embraced the months of May-November and November-May
respectively. On the Sandwich Islands the rainy
season, <i>hooilo</i>, lasted from about Nov. 20 to May 20, the dry
season, <i>kau</i>, from May 20 to Nov. 20<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>. We shall find later<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
that both seasons were named and regulated according to the
visibility or invisibility of the Pleiades. Other writers also give
information for Hawaii. When the sun moved towards the north,
the days were long, the trees bore fruit, and the heat was prevalent:
it was summer; but when the sun moved towards the
south, the nights became longer and the trees were without
fruit: it was winter<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>. <i>Kau</i> was the season when the sun was
directly overhead, when daylight was prolonged, the trade-wind
prevailed, days and nights alike were warm, and the
vegetation put forth new leaves. <i>Hooilo</i> was the season when
the sun declined towards the south, the nights grew longer,
days and nights were cool, and the herbage (lit. vines) died
away: each had six months. On Kauai Island the seasons
were called <i>mahoe-mua</i> and <i>mahoe-hope</i><a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>. In Tahiti the bread-fruit
can be gathered for seven months, for the other five
there is none: for about two months before and after the
southern solstice it is very scarce, but from March to August
exceedingly plentiful. This season is called <i>pa-uru</i> (<i>uru</i> =
‘bread-fruit’)<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>. The recurring scarcity of bread-fruit shewed
the changes in the course of the year, but the Pleiades afforded
a surer limit<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>. In Samoa one authority gives the wet season,
ending in April, and the dry season, which comes to an end
with the palolo fishing in October<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>; another <i>vaipalolo</i>, the
palolo or wet season from October to March, and <i>toe lau</i>,
when the regular trade-winds blow, embracing the other
months<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>; a third the season of fine weather&mdash;in which
however much rain falls in some localities&mdash;and the stormy
season, when it rains heavily<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>. The importance of agriculture
is so great that the seasons in following it may sometimes
depart from the changes of the climate. The Bontoc Igorot
have two seasons which however do not mark the wet and
dry periods, as might be expected in a country where these
two periods occur: <i>cha-kon</i> is the season of rice or ‘palay’
growth and harvesting, <i>ka-sip</i> the remaining portion of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
year<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>. In the New Hebrides the year is divided into two
parts, the periods of yam-planting and harvesting<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>.</p>

<p>In certain localities the atmospheric conditions are such
that two divisions of the year may be distinguished according
to the winds, as for instance in the Marshall Islands, where
there are the months of calm and the months of squalls<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>. More
commonly two seasons are given by the variation of the monsoons,
as on the island of Bali, east of Java: in each case there
were six homonymous months. The Kiwai Papuans have <i>uro</i>,
the comparatively dry season of the south-east monsoon (April-December),
and the time of the prevailing north-west wind,
<i>hurama</i>, a period of alternating calms, storms of wind and
rain, and thunder<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>. A native judge from the island of Vuatam
in the Bismarck Archipelago remarked that the north-west
trade blew throughout the time when the sun was southerly,
that is from November to February, but during the time in
which the sun moved in a northerly direction, May to August,
the south-east monsoon prevailed. On Valam it is said that
the south-east monsoon blows as long as the sun sets WNW,
i. e. from May to August: from the month of November to
February, when it sets WSW, the north-west trade blows<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>.
In Rotuma or Granville Island near the equator periods of six
months are reckoned. The west wind, which blows from October
to April, serves to distinguish these two periods, although
it does not affect the vegetation<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>. The people of the Nicobar
Islands reckon by the south-west monsoon (November to April)<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>.
The Benua-Jahun of the Malay Peninsula distinguish the half-year
of the north monsoon and that of the south monsoon<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>.</p>

<p>It would seem that the whole year might easily arise
through the fusion of these two larger periods: that this is not
the case will be shewn in the following chapter.</p>

<p>These half-years are as a rule well defined, but the natural
conditions upon which they depend are subject to fluctuation,
and in particular there are transitional periods the position
of which cannot be certainly decided. Moreover smaller<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
characteristic periods arise within the larger, and hence more
seasons appear. Elsewhere the natural conditions are such
that they directly lead to more than two seasons, e. g. where
there are two different rainy seasons in the year. From these
circumstances it becomes plain that a fluctuation between a
larger or smaller number of seasons is possible, and indeed it
often actually occurs. The seasons that adhere to natural
phenomena are never clearly defined like a division of the
calendar: the limits are uncertain, different seasons may be
merged into one another or in part overlap one another, as
has been shewn in the case of the Eskimos of Labrador.</p>

<p>Among the Eskimos of the Behring Strait the year is
often divided into four seasons corresponding to the usual occupations,
but these divisions are indefinite and irregular in
comparison with the reckoning by months<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>. Of the Indians in
general it is said that as a rule four seasons are recognised
and have specific names applied to them (apart from the tribes
that have two). In many cases however the latter may split up
both summer and winter into two subdivisions: this is stated e. g.
for the Chocktaw of Louisiana<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>. The Siciatl of British Columbia
however have three: spring, summer, and winter<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>.
The Thompson Indians of the same province group their months
into five seasons, winter beginning with the first snow that
stays on the ground, and lasting until its disappearance from
the valleys, generally the 2d, 3d, and 4th months, spring beginning
with the disappearance of the snow, and embracing
the period of frequent Chinook winds, 5th and 6th months,
summer 7th, 8th, and 9th months, early autumn (Indian summer)
10th and 11th months, and late fall which takes up the rest of
the year<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>. The neighbouring tribe of the Shuswap recognise
five seasons exactly corresponding to those of the Thompson
Indians<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>.</p>

<p>The natural phenomena from which the seasons are determined
and named vary according to the geographical latitude,
the nature of the country, and the mode of life, i. e.
according as the tribe lives by hunting or by agriculture.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
Certain writers state that the Indians of Virginia divided the
year into five seasons: the budding of spring, the earing of
corn or ‘roasting-ear time’, summer or ‘the highest sun’, corn-gathering
or ‘fall of the leaf’, and winter<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>. The Maida of northern
California say that the seasons&mdash;the rainy season, the
leafy season, the dry season, and the season of falling leaves&mdash;were
instituted by Kodoyampeh, the Creator<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>. The Kiowa
distinguished only four seasons: <i>saigya</i> or <i>säta</i>, considered to
begin at the first snowfall; <i>asegya</i>, spring (the etymology of
the word is unknown, a more recent name is <i>son-pata</i>, ‘grass-springing’),
which begins when grass and buds sprout and the
mares foal; <i>paigya</i>, summer (<i>pai</i>, ‘sun’), which begins when
the grass has ceased to sprout and lasts until fires become
necessary in the <i>tipis</i> at night; <i>paongya</i>, autumn (the thickening
of the coat or fur, <i>pa</i>, of the buffalo and other animals),
sometimes called ‘the time when the leaves are red’, begins
when the leaves change colour<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>. It is to be noted that these
seasons must be of very different length. In the same way
the Dakota reckon five months each for winter and summer
and only one month each for spring and autumn, but it is expressly
mentioned that this reckoning is not strictly followed<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>.
The Pawnee divided the year into a warm and a cold period,
and also into the four seasons, each of which however was
normalised to three months<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>. The account of the Comanches
is somewhat indefinite: they have no computation of time beyond
the seasons, which are reckoned by the rising height of the
grass, the fall of the leaves, and the cold and the hot season.
They very seldom reckon in new moons<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>. They have the
four seasons therefore. The Indians of Chile have words for
our four seasons<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned names of the five seasons are those
of the Algonquins of Virginia<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>; the Occaneechi of the same
district call them:&mdash;the budding or blossoming, the ripening,
midsummer, harvest or fall, winter<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>. Certain agricultural tribes
of the east divided autumn into early autumn, when the leaves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
change colour, and late autumn, when they fall, but denoted
the two periods by entirely different names<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>. Agriculture is
responsible for the adding of a fifth season to the four arising
from the warm and the cold periods and the times of transition
between these<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>. But other transitional periods between the
longer seasons also arise independently<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>. The Lapps have names
for the four ordinary seasons, but their language also contains
compounds like ‘spring-winter’, i. e. late winter,&mdash;a compound
also known in Swedish (<i>vår-vinter</i>)&mdash;and ‘autumn-summer’,
i. e. late summer<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>. The Lapps of Västerbotten divide the year
into <i>sjeunjestie</i>, the dark period, and <i>tjuoikestie</i>, the bright period.
They also have four seasons:&mdash;<i>dalvie</i>, winter, from the freezing
of the lakes till the melting of snow; <i>geira</i>, spring, time of
snow-melting and spring floods; <i>gese</i>, summer, from the time
when the earth becomes visible to the fading of the grass;
<i>tjatj</i>, autumn, from this time until the lakes begin to freeze
again. The Lapps speak also of <i>talve-qvoutel</i>, mid-winter,
<i>kese-qvoutel</i>, midsummer, and <i>tjaktje-kese</i>, late summer<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>.</p>

<p>The Yukaghir of N. E. Sibiria use more often the names
of periods or the seasons of the year than the names of the
months. They have six seasons. The limits of these seasons
can hardly have corresponded in former times to fixed dates.
Being at present baptized, they reckon the seasons of the year
according to the Greek-Orthodox holidays; and thus we have
the following seasons:&mdash;1, <i>puge</i>, summer, from St. Akulina to
Mary’s Day, 13th June to 8th September; 2, <i>nade</i>, autumn,
from the 8th of September to St. Michael’s Day, 8th of November;
3, <i>cieje</i>, winter, from the 8th of November to Purification,
2d of February; 4, <i>pore</i>, first spring, from Purification
to St. George’s Day, 23d of April; 5, <i>cille</i>, the second spring,
from the 23d of April to the beginning of snow-melting, usually
to St. Nicholas’ Day, 9th of March; the name denotes the
icy surface forming during the night on the snow, after having
melted during the day, and is also given to a month;
6, <i>conjile</i>, the third spring, from the snow-melting period to
St. Akulina’s Day<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>Africa offers good examples of the fluctuation and further
sub-division of the seasons. The Wagogo of East Africa
divide the year into the dry season, about May to October,
and the rainy season, November to April. In the latter they
further distinguish the little rainy season, <i>songola</i>, November
and December, and the greater one, <i>itika</i>, about February and
March<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>. In the neighbourhood of Mombasa the great rains
begin in April and last approximately for a month, <i>mwaka</i> or
<i>masika</i>: <i>mchoo</i> is a week in August, and <i>vuli</i> a fortnight in
November, with showers. Beyond the seasons the natives have
little idea of the lapse of time<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>. The Wa-Sania of British
East Africa have three periods of four months each, <i>gunu</i>,
<i>adolaia</i>, and <i>huggaia</i>, but no explanation whatever of these
names is given<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>. The Masai divide the rainy season into three
periods, and also have four seasons of three months each:&mdash;(1)
<i>ol dumeril</i>, the time of the lesser rains, preceding that of
the great rains. The latter fall in (2) <i>en gokwa</i>, named after
the Pleiades, which at that time <i>rise</i> low on the <i>western</i> horizon
(<i>sic!</i>). Then follows (3) <i>ol airodjerod</i>, the season of the
gentle after-rains, and then (4) <i>ol ameii</i>, the time of hunger
and drought<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>. Hollis begins the list with the months of the
showers, and calls the season of the great rains <i>l’apaitin le-’l-lengon</i>,
‘the months of plenty’, stating that the latter season,
in which the setting of the Pleiades takes place in the evening,
is called from these <i>loo-’n-gokwa</i><a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>. Among the Ewe tribes
the year has three periods:&mdash;<i>adame</i>, March to June; <i>keleme</i>,
July to October; <i>pepi</i>, November to February. In the first two
much rain falls, so that work in the fields is greatly hindered.
Inland the year begins in March with the yam-sowing, and
ends in February. The three principal seasons include four months
each. Inland <i>keleme</i> also includes another period, <i>masa</i>, September
and October, the second maize-sowing. Hence the name
‘masa-corn’. <i>Pepi</i> is the harmattan time, in which fall yam-harvesting,
grass-drying, and hunting<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>. The Yoruba divide the
year into the dry season, the season of the harmattan wind,
and the rainy season, the last-named being further divided into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
the time of the first rains and that of the last rains or ‘little
rainy season’<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>. In Loango a dry and a rainy season of about
6 months each are distinguished. In many districts there is
also a third season, <i>tschimuna</i>, the time of the ripening of
favourite fruits etc., and the hot seasons are then often simply
called <i>bimuna</i><a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>.</p>

<p>Where two rainy seasons separated by dry seasons occur,
a fuller division of the year presents itself. The Babwende
have five seasons:&mdash;<i>ntombo</i>, from the first rains at the end
of September or beginning of October to the ceasing of the
great rains at the end of January; <i>kianza</i>, the lesser dry season,
to the beginning of the great rains in February; <i>ndolo</i>, the
latter part of the rainy season up to <i>sivu</i>, the dry season,
which begins in June; and <i>mbangala</i>, in August and September,
when the grass withers and is burnt up<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>. The Wadschagga
count:&mdash;the great rainy season, 4 months; the time
of dew, 2 months; the season of heat, about 2 months; the
so-called lesser rainy season, 1&ndash;2 months; the great heat,
about 3 months<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>. The seasons of the Banyankole are determined
by the rains. The longer period is termed <i>kyanda</i> and
usually has six months: the lesser, <i>akanda</i>, has four, and there
are two months called <i>itumba</i>. During the six months very
little rain falls, then come a few days of rain followed by
four months of dry weather, and after that two other months
of rain<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>. A very striking example of the crossing and overlapping
of the seasons is afforded by the Bakongo. They
have <i>sivu</i>, the cold season, at the beginning of the dry season
which commences about May 15; <i>mbangala</i>, the dry season
with little or no dew, July to the middle of October, including
also <i>mpiaza</i>, the grass-burning season, second half of July,
August, and September; <i>masanza</i>, early light rains, latter part
of October, November, and December; <i>nkianza</i>, short dry season,
most of January and the early part of February; <i>kundi</i>,
<i>nsafu</i>, fruit season, end of February to May, including <i>kintombo</i>,
heavy rains, March, April, and <i>nkiela</i>, the time when
the rains cease, from the beginning to the middle of May<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>In the inland districts of Madagascar, in the neighbourhood
of Antananarivo, there are properly only two seasons, a
hot rainy period from the beginning of November to the end
of April, and a cold dry period during the other months.
However four seasons are distinguished:&mdash;<i>lohataona</i>, ‘head
of the year’, September and October, when the rice is planted
and a few showers fall; <i>fahavaratra</i>, ‘the thunder-time’, from the
early part of November to the end of February or into March;
<i>fararano</i>, ‘the last rains’, from the beginning of March to the
end of April; and <i>ririnina</i>, ‘time of bareness’, when the grass
becomes dry, June to August. Rice is planted twice, first
before the end of October and again in November or December;
the first crop is ripe in January or early in February,
the second about April; the two crops however are not clearly
distinguished and together last about four months<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>. One name
for winter is <i>maintang</i>, ‘the earth is dry’<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>.</p>

<p>The Hottentots seem to keep in view the vegetation rather
than the climate. Their seasons are four in number. First,
early spring. When with increasing warmth, independently of
the rain-fall, trees and bushes break into leaf, and in good
years winter or early spring rains have revived the grass,
spring or blossoming-time has come; it begins in August and
ends in October. The following season, which in the upland
Damara dialect is called ‘the sun-time’, embraces the first half
of the hot period in which, when the year is good, the so-called
lesser rains fall. If these are wanting, or, as is usually
the case, are scanty, the land is for the most part desolate,
without grass or herbage. This time of drought is described
by the same word as the drought itself: it prevails
from October to December inclusive. The season upon the
productiveness of which the welfare of the Hottentots in
the main depends may be called the pasture-season: it includes
the period of the greater rains and the time immediately
after this, when the fodder has not yet lost its freshness.
It fills, loosely speaking, the period January-April, and constitutes
summer and early autumn. Winter, or the cold season,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
May to August, embraces two-thirds of autumn and the
first half of winter<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>. The Herero also have four seasons:&mdash;spring
(from September onwards), summer, autumn or the rainy season,
and winter<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>.</p>

<p>In Burmah there are three seasons, though certainly they
are regulated by the months: the cold season, the hot season,
and the rainy season<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>. The Polynesians usually have two long
seasons, but three are not unheard of. A native of the island
of Molokai, in the Sandwich group, states that there the year
was divided into three seasons:&mdash;<i>maka-lii</i>, <i>kau</i>, and <i>hoo-ilo</i>.
<i>Maka-lii</i> was so called because the sun was then less visible,
being obscured by clouds, and the days were shortened. <i>Kau</i>
was so termed because tapa could then safely be spread out
to dry. <i>Hoo-ilo</i> meant ‘changeable’<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>. The two main seasons
are called <i>kau</i> and <i>hoo-ilo</i>. It is to be observed however
that in a notice from Hawaii they are called <i>hoo-ilo</i> and <i>maka-lii</i><a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>.
This shews that the number is not fixed. On the Society Islands
besides the two seasons regulated by the Pleiades
there were also three seasons: (1) <i>tetau</i>, autumn or season of
plenty, the harvest of bread-fruit, commencing with December and
continuing until <i>faahu</i>, which corresponded to January and a part
of February, the time of the most frequent rains, comprising
three months; (2) <i>te tau miti rahi</i>, the season of high
sea, November to January; (3) <i>te tau poai</i>, the longest season,
winter, the season of drought and scarcity of food, which usually
extended from July to October<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>. It will however be seen
that these seasons do not fill up the year, and that the second
partly covers the first. Their names are taken from different
phenomena of Nature. The New Zealanders distinguish
four seasons:&mdash;spring, <i>te aro aro</i>, <i>mahaua</i>, <i>te toru</i>, ‘the time
of growth’, both <i>toru</i> and <i>aro aro</i> signify ‘the shooting or
springing forth of plants’, <i>mahaua</i> is the season of warmth; summer,
<i>raumati</i>, <i>waru</i>, <i>rehua</i>,&mdash;<i>raumati</i> means ‘dead leaves’, and
the summer is so called because all the trees with one exception
are evergreen and shed their leaves in summer; autumn,
<i>ngahura matiti</i>; winter, <i>hotoke</i>, <i>puanga</i>, the season when the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
earth is damp and gives forth her worms, which were formerly
highly prized as food<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>. The seasons are regulated by the
stars, <i>puanga</i> is the great winter star, <i>rehu</i> the great summer star.</p>

<p>The names of the greater seasons are therefore taken
for the most part from the varying phases of the climate, but
very often refer also to the phenomena of natural life accompanying
these. The climatic phases, on account of their
fluctuating duration and their limited number, afford no means
of distinguishing and naming a greater number of smaller
seasons: the phases of plant and animal life may be used as
an equivalent and are much better adapted to this purpose,
especially when to them are added the regular occupations
of agriculture. In the above examples terms referring to natural
life have already been found mingled with those borrowed
from the climate. Where the seasons are numerous this
is always the case: direct references to the climate may even
be entirely lacking. These facts shew moreover that between
the largest and smallest seasons there exists no difference
in the main: they pass into one another without interruption
through a series of intermediate stages. Such smaller seasons
may be run together into the circle of the year; but this seldom
occurs, since the ordinary reckoning according to lunar months
has absorbed the smaller seasons, which, on account of their
varying and indeterminate length, are inconvenient for reckoning,
whereas the regular and definite length of the months makes
them easy to reckon. It is however sometimes the case.</p>

<p>The Indians in general have lunar months named from
natural occurrences, but not so the Luiseño of Southern
California. According to P. S. Sparkman in his unpublished
Dictionary of their language the Luiseño year was divided
into 8 periods, each of which was again divided into two parts,
distinguished as ‘large’ and ‘small’ or ‘lean’. These divisions
did not represent periods of time but merely indicated when
certain fruits and seeds ripened, grass began to grow, and
trees came into leaf in the valley or on the mountain. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
native names are given but are unfortunately not translated.
Du Bois, to whom we are indebted for this information, names
the parts ‘months’ (in inverted commas), and adds that the
names are all taken from the physical features of different
seasons. <i>Tausunmal</i>, about August, means that everything is
brown and sear. <i>Tovukmal</i> refers to the little streams of
water washing the fallen leaves. <i>Tasmoimal</i> means that the
rain has come and grass is sprouting. In <i>nemoimal</i> the deer
grow fat. The ‘months’ are marked by the rising of certain
stars. The seasons have here developed into a regular calendrical
cycle<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>.</p>

<p>In reality this cycle is in no way distinguished from the
succession of seasons given above: it has only been improved
and regulated. This happens more particularly under the influence
of agriculture; one can speak of an agricultural year
the seasons of which are determined and named in accordance
with agriculture. Of the Fanti of the Gold Coast it is said
that they divide the year, according to the changes of the
climate, into nine parts with distinct names, beginning with
the harmattan wind in January and ending with the small
tornadoes in December<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>. The periods however are related
to agriculture, as appears from a detailed description for the
countries around the Niger. The end of the rainy season and
the beginning of the dry (about November) forms a kind of
season by itself, and is called <i>odun</i> (year). The farmers go
on weeding their farms to give the crops of their second harvest
a chance. The dry season is divided into two sections
of two months each. During the day it is very hot. The
cold wind blowing from the east is called <i>harmattan</i> by Europeans,
<i>oye</i> by the natives. The second crops of corn, beans,
and guinea-corn are now gathered. The land is cleared for
the next season’s crops, and the bush already felled is burnt.
This is also the fishing season. The dry season (<i>erun</i>) continues
for the next two months, but during the latter part of
the second month the rumbling of thunder is heard and small
rains fall. The preparation of the ground is continued and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
yam-planting begins. The rainy season may be divided into
two parts separated by a little dry season: the first section
consists of five lunar months of rain, the latter of two lunar
months, one nearly dry month intervening. The first two
months of this section of the rains are called <i>asheroh ojo</i>: it
is the tornado season. At the beginning of this season ground-nuts
and the first crop of corn are planted. In the next two
months the rain-fall reaches its maximum. Towards the end
of the second month it becomes possible to eat new corn.
The main crop however is left standing in the fields until it
becomes quite dry, which happens when the next season, the
little dry season, sets in. This sub-division of the rainy season
is called <i>ago</i>, probably because the corn has grown tall during
the last month. The season called <i>awori</i> consists of one month
of rain and the little dry season. The first crop of yams, the
corn, the ground-nuts, and the gourds are gathered in. Before
long the rains have ceased, the seed for the second crop of
corn is sown. The two following months are called the <i>arokuro</i>
season, and like the first two months of the rains they
are tornado months. Bushes are felled in order to prepare
the land for next year’s sowing, and weeding is continued<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>.
The months mentioned are lunar months. An interesting
feature is that the names of the seasons do not altogether
coincide with the natural divisions of the climate, as the
following comparison clearly shews:&mdash;<i>odun</i>, end of rains, beginning
of dry season; <i>erun</i>, dry season I, II, 4 months; <i>asheroh
ojo</i>, season of rains (tornadoes), 2 months; <i>ago</i>, rainy season,
maximum, 2 months; <i>awori</i>, 1 month rain and little dry season;
<i>arokuro</i>, season of rains (tornadoes), 2 months. The deviations
are brought about, as the description shews, by the business of
agriculture.</p>

<p>The Shilluk know the months but also divide the year
into the following nine seasons:&mdash;<i>yey jeria</i>, about September,
harvest of red dura; <i>anwoch</i>, about October, end of the harvest,
people are waiting for white dura to ripen; <i>agwero</i>,
about November-December, harvest of white dura begins;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
<i>wudo</i>, December to January, harvest of white dura continues;
<i>leu</i>, January-February, the hot season, <i>dodin</i>, about March,
in these two there is no work in the fields; <i>dokot</i>, about April,
‘mouth of rain’, beginning of the rains; <i>shwer</i>, about May-July,
time for planting red dura; <i>doria</i>, about July-September,
beginning of harvest<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>. A similar but more indefinite mode of
reckoning seems to exist among the Bakairi of S. America,
of whom it is said that they reckon by dry and rainy seasons,
and also distinguish ‘months’ not by the moon but quite vaguely
by the rain and the heat and the phases of the maize-culture<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>.
Their months are given as follows:&mdash;‘hardest rain’, about
January; ‘less rain’, February; ‘rain ceases’, March; ‘it (the
weather) becomes good’, April; ‘wood-cutting’, May and June;
July, nameless; ‘end-of-the-day-time’, August; ‘the rain is coming’,
September and October; ‘the maize ripens’, November;
December, nameless<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>.</p>

<p>The agricultural year is most clearly defined among the
rice-cultivating peoples of the Indian Archipelago, by whom
the seasons are determined according to the state of the rice.
It is said, for example, in speaking of an event, that it happened
at the blossoming or harvesting of the rice<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>. Among
the Bahau, a Dyak tribe of Borneo, the year is divided into
eight periods according to the various kinds of labour carried
on in the rice-field:&mdash;the clearing of the brushwood (to prepare
the fields for cultivation), the felling of the trees, the
burning of the wood felled, the sowing or celebration of the
seed-time festival, the weeding, the harvest, the conclusion of
the harvest, the celebration of the new rice-year<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>. The Bontoc
Igorot, as has been mentioned, divide the year into two parts,
the period of rice-culture and the other period. There are
however other periods which vary in different villages as
regards name, number, and duration, but are everywhere called
after the characteristic occupations that follow one another
in the course of the year. Eight of these together make up
the calendar, and seven of them have to do with the rice-cultivation.
Each period receives its name from the occupation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
which characterises its beginning, and keeps this name
until the beginning of the next period, even when the occupation
that characterised it had ceased some time before. To
<i>cha-kon</i> belong:&mdash;(1) <i>i-na-na</i>, the first period in the year, the
time, as it is said, of no more work in the rice sementeras,
when practically all the fields are prepared and transplanted; in
1903 it began on Feb. 11 and it lasts about 3 months, continuing
until the time of the first rice-harvest in May, in 1903
till May 2; (2) <i>la-tub</i>, the time of the first harvests, lasts about
four weeks and ends about June 1; (3) <i>cho-ok</i>, the time when
most of the rice is harvested, fills about 4 weeks, in 1903 till
July 2; (4) <i>li-pas</i>, the season of ‘no more palay-harvest’, lasts
for about 10 or 15 days. To the half-year <i>ka-sip</i>, belong:&mdash;(5)
<i>ba-li-ling</i>, which takes its name from the general planting
of camotes and is the only one of the calendar periods not
named from the rice industry: it lasts about 6 weeks, or nearly to
the end of August; (6) <i>sa-gan-ma</i>, the time when the sementeras
which are to be used as seed-beds for the rice are put
into condition, the earth being turned three several times,
lasts about 2 months: on Nov. 15, 1902 the seed was just peeping
from the kernels; the seed is sown immediately after the third
turning of the earth, which thus ended early in November;
(7) <i>pa-chog</i>, the period of seed-sowing, begins about Nov. 10;
although the seed-sowing does not last many days, the period
continues for 5 or 6 weeks; (8) <i>sa-ma</i>, the last period, in which
the sementeras are prepared for receiving the young plants,
and in which these seedlings are transplanted from the seed-beds,
lasts nearly 7 weeks, from about Dec. 20 to Feb. 10.
The Igorot often say e. g. that an event occurred in <i>la-tub</i> or will
take place in <i>ba-li-ling</i>; they therefore keep these periods in
mind just as a European thinks of some particular month in
which an event has happened<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>. The greatly varying length
of the periods is once more to be noted, and also the fact
that a vacant season is made into a period (see e. g. under
(7)), it being necessary to fill in the gaps so that the circle
shall be continuous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>How such seasons and the year formed out of them may
be developed under the influence of the improved calendar
into periods of definite numbers of days is shewn by the Javanese
peasant calendar which is still used in Bali and Java. The year
is an embolimic year of 360 days and is divided into 12 periods
of unequal length. These are:&mdash;<i>koso</i>, 41 days; <i>karo</i>, 23; <i>katigo</i>,
24; <i>kapat</i>, 24 (25)<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>; <i>kalimo</i>, 26 (27); <i>kanam</i>, 41 (43); <i>kapitu</i>,
41 (43); <i>kawolu</i>, 26 (in leapyear 27); <i>kasongo</i>, 25; <i>kasapuluh</i>,
25 (24); <i>dasto</i>, 23; <i>sodo</i>, 41. The first ten of these names are
the ordinal numerals of the Javanese vernacular, the last two,
according to Wilken, are corruptions of Sanskrit words. In
Bali the year begins with the eleventh season (April), in Java
with the winter solstice. The different divisions correspond
to the following occupations and natural events:&mdash;1, the
falling of the leaves, burning of dry grass, and cutting of trees
for the cultivation of mountain rice; 2, beginning of vegetation;
3, blossoming of wild plants, planting of yams and other
secondary crops; 4, rutting season, high winds, the rivers swell;
5, preparations for rice-planting; 6, ploughing and rice-sowing;
7, rice is planted, the canals are repaired; 8, rice grows and
flowers; 9, the seeds form in the rice-plants; 10, rice turning
yellow; 11, the rice-crop is ripe, harvest begins; 12, cold
weather begins, the harvest is finished and the rice housed.
This is almost literally translated from the language of the natives<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>.
Wilken gives to certain periods a different number of
days (see <a href="#Footnote_316">note 1</a>); according to him the year has 365 days,
but every fourth year is a leapyear with 366 days. The calendar
was regulated in 1855 by Pakoe Boewånå III, naturally
according to the Gregorian calendar: hence the variation from
Crawfurd’s statements. This is the only instance of an attempt
to bring a natural calendar into agreement with the demands
of a modern one; it is however unpractical and inconvenient
on account of the varying length of the divisions. It is still
used in eastern Java and in the Tengge mountains<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>.</p>

<p>In China, besides the lunisolar type of year, there is a
division of the year into 24 parts, the names of which correspond<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
to the climatic phenomena but are also borrowed from
the phenomena of natural life. They are:&mdash;rain-water, 15
days; moving of snakes, 15 days; spring equinox, 15 days;
pure brightness, 15 days; sowing-rain and dawn of summer,
together 31 days; little fruitfulness (Ginzel) or little rainy season
(d’Enjoy), corn in the beard, together 31 days; summer
solstice, 16 days; beginning of heat, 16 days; great heat, signs
of autumn, together 31 days; end of heat, white dew, together
31 days; cold dew, 15 days; autumn equinox, 15 days; hoar-frost,
15 days; signs of winter, 15 days, beginning of snow,
great snows, together 29 days; winter solstice, 15 days; little
cold, 15 days; great cold, 15 days; dawn of spring, 15 days<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>.
Of this division Ginzel says that among the Chinese the seasons
are expressed by a division of the ecliptic: they are therefore
astronomical, the Chinese have no special names for the
physical seasons. In former times they took the length of the
astronomical year to be 365¼ days, and assumed an equal
period for the course of the sun in the ecliptic; but they afterwards
learnt to calculate the beginning of the divisions directly.
It would be surprising however not to find underlying the present
divisions old seasons which the astronomical knowledge
has drawn within its scope, and which have thus been systematically
developed and regulated. To decide the matter would
require special knowledge which the present writer does not
possess. It is to be noted moreover that the periods are connected
in pairs, the odd numbers (according to Ginzel’s scheme)
are called <i>tsie</i>, the even <i>k’i</i>, the joint name being <i>tsie-k’i</i>.</p>

<p>As far as the Indo-European period is concerned it seems
now to be agreed that there were then three seasons: for only
the roots occurring in the words <i>hiems</i>, <i>ver</i>, and <i>summer</i> recur
in a greater number of the Indo-European languages. The
much criticised statement of Tacitus about the Germans is therefore
corroborated: “They know and name winter and spring
and summer, but are ignorant of the name and the goods of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
harvest”<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>. Spring however is not equivalent to the other two
seasons, for Indo-European antiquity certainly also divided the
year into two parts, the cold and the warm seasons. The
question whether the primitive Indo-European tribe had two
or three seasons is therefore pointless, and that this is so will
be readily understood by anyone who has become familiar
with the overlapping and the instability of the seasons of the
primitive peoples. The same phenomenon repeats itself in the
addition of a fourth season. The Greeks complete the circle
of the year with the three seasons winter, spring, and summer
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χειμών, ἔαρ, θέρος</span>), but in Homer the fruit-harvest, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀπώρη</span>, already
appears with the pretensions of an independent season.
Alkman has these four<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>. The principle of nomenclature is
however different: the first three names are derived from climatic
phenomena, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀπώρα</span> from the fruit-harvest. Now since
four climatic periods are naturally to be distinguished&mdash;cold,
warmth, and two transitional periods&mdash;the logical consequence
is that the fourth season should also be referred to the
climate, and indeed to the still unnamed period of transition
between summer and winter. This period however does not
coincide with <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀπώρα</span>, but follows it. The latter term is therefore
corrected to <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φθιν-</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μετόπωρον</span>; the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀπώρα</span> naturally persists as
the fruit harvest, and Theophrastus<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> counts it in addition to the
other four and thus gets five seasons. The same thing seems
to have happened in the case of the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">autumnus</i>,
although the process cannot be demonstrated. If the small
seasons are included the circle may be still further extended.
Thus the pseudo-Hippocratean treatise <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Περὶ ἑβδομάδων</span><a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> gives
seven seasons:&mdash;1, seed-time, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σπορητός</span>, from the early rising
of the Pleiades to the winter solstice; 2, winter, until the late
rising of Arcturus; 3, tree-planting, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φυταλιά</span>, up to the spring
equinox; 4, spring; 5, summer, from the early rising of the
Pleiades up to that of Sirius; 6, fruit-harvest, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀπώρα</span>, until the
early rising of Arcturus; 7, autumn. This arrangement is certainly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
affected by the septenary system which pervades the
treatise, but is founded on a popular basis: the smaller seasons,
which otherwise pass into the greater, are given an independent
position by the side of these. The system has not prevailed,
it is true, but it affords a typical example of the instability of
the seasons.</p>

<p>Exactly the same process recurs in the Indian seasons.
The natural division of the North Indian year is into three
periods&mdash;a warm, a rainy, and a cold season. Three corresponding
seasons are the most usual in the Vedic period, and
these are still the popular divisions in the Punjab. Later two
transitional periods are interpolated, one of an autumnal character
between the rainy season and the cold season, and a
warm period between the cold season and the hot. These five
seasons often occur in the Brahmanas. The well-known six seasons&mdash;<i>vasanta</i>,
spring; <ins class="corr" id="tn-73" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'grishna, hot season'">
<i>grishma</i>, hot season</ins>; <i>varsha</i>, rainy
season; <i>śarad</i>, autumn; <i>hemanta</i>, winter; <i>śiśira</i>, cool season:
the cold season is divided into two periods&mdash;are the result
of a systematic comparison with the months, the latter being
distributed in pairs among the seasons. By this arrangement
the rainy season is the loser, since it embraces at least three
months. There is also a second sexpartite division of the year,
not indeed mentioned in the Vedic literature but better corresponding
to the course of the seasons, in which the rainy
season is divided into two periods<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>.</p>

<p>The splitting up of the seasons persists to this day among
the Germanic peoples; but a systematising of these small
seasons is only found when they are referred to the Julian
months. This point will be dealt with below, in chapter XI.
The phenomenon is known to me from my own native district.
The word <i>höst</i>, ‘autumn’, still persists there in the old literal
sense of harvest, mowing, and indeed <i>höhösten</i> is particularly
the hay-harvest. Hence the designation of the autumn season
as <i>höst</i> is felt to be insufficiently accurate and the term is replaced
by <i>efterhöst</i>, literally ‘after-harvest’, late autumn. Between
summer and <i>efterhöst</i> appears the <i>skyr</i> (dialect for <i>skörd</i>), the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
harvest, as a fifth season; sometimes there is added a sixth
season, <i>sivinter</i>, late winter. Little attention has been paid
to this phenomenon, though it is common enough. The periods
of the rural occupations in particular give rise to such terms.
Any period of this nature is described by the old Swedish word
<i>and</i> (<i>ann</i>), now obsolete except in dialects. For the other districts
I add from the Dialect Dictionary of Rietz:&mdash;<i>hobal</i>,
the period on the one hand between the tillage in spring and
the hay-harvest, and on the other between the hay- and the
corn-harvest, the former period being the greater, the latter
the small <i>hobal</i>. Elsewhere the word has the form <i>hovel</i>,
summer being divided into <i>hoveln</i>, <i>mellan-anna</i> and <i>ann</i> (which
is here used pregnantly to mean harvest). Compounds with
<i>and</i> are <i>vår-</i>, <i>säs-</i>, <i>gödsel-</i>, <i>hö-</i>, <i>slått-</i>, <i>skår-</i>, <i>skyr-</i> and <i>sädes-and</i>
(periods of spring, sowing, manuring, hay, hay-harvest,
harvest, corn). The North Frisians of Amrum and Föhr for
instance mark events by the periods <i>um julham</i> (‘at Christmas’),
<i>um wosham</i> (‘in early spring’), <i>pluchleth</i> (ploughing-time), <i>meedarleth</i>
(hay-harvest), <i>kaarskörd</i> (corn-reaping). In Norway there
are current as general time-indications:&mdash;fishing-time (<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">fiskja</i>),
springtime (<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">voarvinna</i> or <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">voaronn</i>), ploughing-time (<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">plogen</i> or
<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">plogvinna</i>), midsummer (<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">haavoll</i> or <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">haaball</i>), ‘between time’, i. e.
between ploughing and hay-making, (<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">mellonn</i>), early summer
(<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">leggsumar</i>), haymaking-time (<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">høyvinna</i>, <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">høyonn</i>, or <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">slaatt</i>), harvest-time
(<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">haustvinna</i> or <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">skurd</i>), ‘shortest-days-time’ (<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">skamtid</i>)<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>.
In Iceland, where the sheep-farming is the principal industry,
we find:&mdash;Lamb-weaning time or Pen-tide, <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">stekk-tid</i>, in May;
Parting-tide, <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">fra-faerar</i>, when the sheep are driven to the
hills; Market-tide, <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">kaup-tid</i>, when all purchases for the year
are made; Home-field hay-time and Out-field hay-time (July
and August); Folding-tide, <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">rettir</i> (September), when the sheep
are driven off the hill pastures into folds to be separated into
flocks and marked. Again from wild birds and eider-ducks one
calls the spring Egg-tide. The fisherman uses such seasons as
<i lang="is" xml:lang="is">ver-tid</i>, Fishing-tide; of these there is a spring, an autumn,
and a winter fishing-month. Flitting-days, <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">fardagar</i>, come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
in the spring, and <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">skil-dagar</i> in summer, when servants leave.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>
In the old German laws and elsewhere similar time-indications
are common, e. g. at plough-time, at the second plough-time,
at autumn-sowing, at harvest, at hay-making time, at hemp-gathering,
after harvest and hay-making, at the bean-harvest,
at plough-time, at the grape-harvest, at sowing-time, at harvest-time,
fall of the leaves, sprouting of the leaves, oat-cutting or
harvest<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>. In Anglo-Saxon a similar expression occurs in
a law of King Vihtraed in the year 696, <i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">sexton dæge rugernes</i>
(rye-harvest). These periods are in themselves indefinite, they
fail to achieve a definite length or quite fixed position in the year.
Where they do so, this is due to the comparison with the
Julian months, of which more later.</p>

<p>However over the number of the seasons among the Germans
or, what has often been regarded as the same thing,&mdash;and
this is an evidence of the false methods by which the problem
has been attacked&mdash;over the German division of the year, a
long and vigorous dispute has been carried on. That the year
was divided into two parts, summer and winter, is well known.
I refer to the Scandinavian half-years<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>, to the testimony of
Bede<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> that the Anglo-Saxons reckoned six months for winter
and six for summer, and to the German expressions for a year:
‘in bareness and in leaf’, ‘bare and leaf-clad’, ‘in straw and
in grass’<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>. No less a scholar than J. Grimm has cast doubt
on the statement of Tacitus that the Germans had only three
seasons, but later he withdrew his doubts in view of the consideration
that the Germans at the time of Tacitus were acquainted
with grain-culture but not with fruit-culture, and that the
word autumn, harvest, referred to the fruit and vine-harvests
and therefore naturally did not appear among the Germans of
that time<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>. In view of the linguistic phenomenon mentioned
<a href="#Page_71">above, p. 71</a>, it seems now to be agreed that the account of Tacitus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
is in the main correct. Weinhold has given the treatment of
the question its direction. According to him the tripartite division
to which reference has been made crowded out the
older division into two parts, the points of division, he maintains,
doubtless coinciding in the first instance with the three
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Lauddinge</i> or <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ungebotene Gerichte</i> (regular courts), which are
found as early as the time of Charlemagne. The beginnings
of the four seasons&mdash;determined from saints’ days&mdash;in February,
May, August, and November are of foreign origin: on
the other hand the quadripartite division of the year, arising
from the fact that mid-winter and midsummer were added to
the beginning of winter and summer as interpolations in the
time-reckoning, is German. This Weinhold tries to prove from
the popular festivals associated with these dates. The attempt
however is a complete failure. No season begins with any of
the solstices, on the contrary these fall right in the middle of
a season. His thesis rests on an erroneous conception of the
festivals, viz. that they are in general calendar-festivals. Under
primitive conditions a festival (the harvest-home in particular)
may certainly conclude a division of time and may
thus also indicate the beginning of a new season, but as a
rule the festivals, though regulated by the calendar, are not
so ordered that they coincide with the beginning of a season.
We are therefore not authorised in drawing conclusions as to
the beginning of a division of the year from the existence of
an old festival. Support has been lent to the idea of Weinhold
by the fact that in later times the beginnings of the seasons
were indicated by festivals and saints’ days. The fact of the matter
is that the common medieval calendar was composed of a
series of festivals and saints’ days from among which suitable
and well-known days were chosen in the dating of the beginnings
of the seasons also. For the general understanding it
was necessary throughout to bring in popular saints’ days<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>.
Tille attacks Weinhold very sharply but remains throughout
under the influence of the method indicated by the latter: his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
work, however, has its good points, inasmuch as it refers to
economic conditions, agriculture, the payments of rent, etc.
The bipartite division, he asserts, is primitive Indo-European,
the tripartite is of foreign (Egyptian) origin: both existed for a
long time side by side. This fact is explained by an old sexpartite
division of the year, since the six seasons could be run
together either in twos or in threes. The beginnings of the
half-years are given by natural phenomena, those of the three
annual divisions are placed by Tille at March 13, July 10, and
Nov. 11, old style: in the north on account of the climatic
conditions they are pushed back a month. Hammarstedt<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> remarks
very pertinently that the beginning of winter in November,
in the north in October, belongs to the reckoning in half-years,
and that hence arises the absurdity that Tille has to give
Feb. 10 as the date for the beginning of spring in the north.
But to assign Dec. 13 with Hammarstedt as the beginning of
one of the three seasons agrees just as little with the natural
seasons of the year.</p>

<p>The principal error lies in the systematising, the seasons
being regarded as periods of a definite number of days. This
is not the case even to-day, and still less was it so, as we
have seen, among primitive peoples. Still more clearly does
the same error of method appear in Tille’s assumption of a
sexpartite division of the year, or of sixty-day periods, as they
are expressly termed. He refers to the six old Indian seasons,
which are a comparatively late and artificial product called
forth by the adoption of the names of the seasons in the reckoning
by months<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>, and to the pairs of months of the Syrian and
Arabian calendar. He regards as 60-day divisions not only the
smaller seasons mentioned <a href="#Page_75">above, p. 75</a>, the duration of which
was originally no less indefinite than it is to-day, but also the
Germanic pairs of months, which owe their origin to an adaptation
of the Roman months (for this see <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">below, ch. XI</a>). The 60-day
periods are so far from being primitive that they first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
took their origin under the influence of the reckoning in
months.</p>

<p>In Iceland there still exists a curious calendar, the ‘week-year’.
The year is divided into two halves, <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">misseri</i>; the
people reckon in so many <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">misseri</i>, not years; it consists of <em>whole</em>
weeks, in the ordinary year 52 (= 364 days), in leapyear 53
(= 371 days). Until midsummer (or mid-winter) they reckon forwards,
so many weeks of summer or winter have elapsed,
after that backwards, so many weeks of summer (winter)
remain<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>. Bilfinger in a penetrating study has tried to shew
that this curious calendar is an outcome of the ecclesiastical
calendarial science of the Middle Ages. He does not however
prove his case: rather, the calendar, as tradition shews, reaches
far back into heathen times<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>.</p>

<p>The reckoning in weeks was once common to all Scandinavia.
The Lapps have special names for every week of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
year, borrowed from festivals and saints’ days falling within
the weeks; they have therefore taken from the Scandinavians<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
the reckoning in weeks and adapted it to the uses of a primitive
time-reckoning. From the same source they have also
derived the special significance of the summer night (April 14,
Tiburtius) and of the winter night (Oct. 14, Calixtus), from
which also two weeks are named. The system is better preserved
in certain parts of South Sweden<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>. The people count in <i lang="sv" xml:lang="sv">räppar</i>,
quarter-years&mdash;in Öland they are called <i lang="sv" xml:lang="sv">trettingar</i>, thirteenths,
i. e. 13 weeks&mdash;beginning with the <i lang="sv" xml:lang="sv">räppadagar</i>: these are
Lady Day, Midsummer Day, Michaelmas Day, and Christmas
Day, old style. Just as in Iceland, they reckon backwards, not
however in the same quarters as there, but in the quarters before
Midsummer and Christmas: in the other two quarters they
count forwards. In northern Scania I have met with a relic
of the same type of reckoning, the ‘number of weeks’ (<i lang="sv" xml:lang="sv">ugetalet</i>),
which begins on April 6 (Lady Day, old style), and is reckoned
backwards as far as the thirteenth week. The duration of both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
rural occupations and natural phenomena is determined in so
many weeks. As the starting-point of this reckoning in weeks
the four great festivals which come nearest to the four points
of the solstices and equinoxes are chosen. There can be no
doubt that these have made their appearance under the influence
of the Christian calendar instead of the four Old Scandinavian
points of division of the year. The people call Calixtus’ day
(Oct. 14) the first day of winter, and Tiburtius’ day (April 14)
the first day of summer; many rune-staves have this division
of the year, and almost all describe the former by a tree
without leaves, the latter by a tree in leaf. They fall in the
same weeks as the initial days of winter and summer in Iceland,
which vary there on account of the peculiar arrangement of
the calendar. In Scandinavia, however, they have been transformed
into fixed days under the influence of the Julian calendar.</p>

<p>It is a natural conclusion that the reckoning in weeks had
its origin in the use of the rune-staff. Since the week-day
letters on these are repeated the whole year through, the
weeks offered an easy means of reckoning. This conclusion is
certainly correct, but still we may venture to ask why the
week-day letters were admitted into the national calendar by
the North especially, and why the reckoning in weeks should
be adopted in popular use only there. The reason can only
be that the counting in weeks was already in use before the
rune-staff was introduced. This mode of counting, which in
Iceland had been developed into a curious form of year, was
in Scandinavia adapted to the Julian calendar and remained
bound up with this. The leap-week was therefore unnecessary.
The old basis is however still preserved in the points of departure,
the summer and winter nights. It is the same system
as the Icelandic, built up on the week and the year, but
differently modified: the idea of any borrowing cannot be entertained.
The basis of this calendar, therefore, was once common
to all Scandinavia, and the calendar must go back to
heathen times.</p>

<p>Under the influence of the popular lay astrology the week
was early spread among the Germanic peoples: on it and on
an approximate knowledge of the length of the year, such as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
could easily be acquired in the lively intercourse with Christian
lands during the Viking period, the system of the Icelandic
calendar is built up. An indigenous element however
appears, the half-year reckoning, and indeed the great probability
is that the limitation of the half-year to a fixed number
of days was first achieved as a result of this systematising of
the calendar. Winter and summer, like all natural seasons,
had at first no fixed limits. The quarters arose in the course
of the reckoning, the people counting forwards in the first half
of the half-year and backwards in the other half. The middle
points of the half-year, mid-winter and midsummer, fell where
both reckonings met. This agrees with the popular objection
to high numbers. The Germanic tribes of the south, in accordance
with their milder climate, commonly reckoned five months
for winter. In the north the dead season is longer, about six
months, and this fact has contributed to the half-year reckoning
which, as has already been remarked, is widely characteristic
of northern peoples. That the limits between both seasons
were unstable and could be moved forward according to circumstances
is in my opinion shewn by the names of the initial
days of the half-year&mdash;<i>sumarmál</i> (plural) and <i>vetrnaetr</i>, ‘the
winter nights’. Where a definitely determined day is in question
the plural is out of place: it is used to describe a period,
for instance <i>jol</i> (plur.) denotes Christmas-time<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>.</p>

<p>With the two opening days of the calendar and the one
division in the middle are often combined the three great sacrificial
feasts, the autumn festival at the winter nights, the Yule
festival at mid-winter, and the spring festival at the summer
nights. It is true that the first of these festivals, which was
celebrated at the beginning of a period of rest after the completion
of the harvest and agricultural labour, denoted, as such
festivals often do, the conclusion of the old year and the beginning
of the new. That it was fixed for a definite day cannot
be demonstrated any more than that the festival of victory in
spring, celebrated before the Vikings went forth on their voyages,
fell exactly on the summer night. On the contrary the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
time probably varied according to circumstances: the expression
of Snorre lacks calendarial accuracy and remains indefinite:&mdash;“They
should sacrifice against the winter to get a
good year, and at mid-winter sacrifice for germination; the
third sacrifice in summer, and this was a sacrifice of victory”<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>.
In historical times the Yule festival is regulated by the
Christian calendar; Snorre says that in heathen times it was
celebrated at the <i>hökku</i> night, but of this we have no certain
knowledge. Things happened as in the Middle Ages and later:
after a calendar has arisen the festivals are regulated by this,
but they are not calendar-festivals, and in reconstructing the
scheme of the calendar from the festivals very great caution
must be exercised.</p>

<p>Our conclusion is that the Germanic seasons, like the
seasons in general, were not in themselves definitely limited
divisions of time, and that alongside of the greater seasons
smaller ones arose without there being any numerical determination
of the relationship between the two. Seasons only
become divisions consisting of a definite number of days when
in the regulation of the calendar they are taken over as calendar
divisions, as winter and summer were in Scandinavia.
Where a calendar has arisen directly out of the seasons, the
divisions, like the seasons, are of varying length<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>. This also
shews that the Germanic seasons first attained a definite number
of days through the calendar-regulation introduced from
abroad. Further, when a calendar existed, the beginning of the
seasons could be given with reference to this: the day varied
according to circumstances, but the choice was limited in this
manner, viz. that only a popular festival or saint’s day was
appropriate as a distinguishing day. Here also, therefore, the
calendar was the starting-point for the regulation of the seasons.
A division of the year in the more accurate sense also first
arose through the regulation of the calendar, since, owing to the
method of calculation, the middle days of the half-year divisions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
became distinguishing days in the calendar. When the calendar
came, the old festivals were also regulated by it.</p>

<p>By way of supplement two or three curious exceptional
cases may be noted. A completely isolated instance is offered
by the Bangala of the Upper Congo, who count in lunar months,
and, since there is no dry season, reckon for longer periods
by the rise of the rivers<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>. In the monsoon districts however
it is frequently a peculiarity to distinguish the seasons by the
winds. Of Sumatra it is reported:&mdash;The principal seasons
are named after the quarters of the heavens from which the
wind blows. At the time when we were in Taluk, April to
mid-June, the south monsoon was blowing; the east, the west,
and the north monsoons also come under consideration for the
seasons. Moreover the people also distinguish a dry and a
rainy period. The seasons 4. <i>tahun djin</i>, 5. <i>tahun wou</i>, 6. <i>tahun
sai</i> were regarded as falling within the rainy period, while
the dry season set in with 1. <i>t. ali</i>, and continued with 2. <i>t. dal awal</i>,
and 3. <i>t. dal akhir</i>. In the two seasons 7. <i>t. ha</i> and 8.
<i>t. ‘am</i> dry and wet weather alternate<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>. In New Britain (Bismarck
Archipelago), between the two greater seasons of the
south-east and the north-west monsoons, each consisting of 5
months, there were two smaller intermediate seasons of one
month each, the period of variable winds and the period of
calm<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>. In Songa (Vellalavella), one of the Solomon Islands,
various seasons are distinguished according to the direction of
the wind:&mdash;the time of the west wind, <i>nanano</i>; the time of
the almond-ripening, <i>tovarauru</i> (the time of the north wind);
<i>rari</i>, the time of the south wind&mdash;during this period calm prevails
at night but there is wind in the day-time; <i>sassa nanamo</i>,
time of the east wind; <i>mbule</i>, time of calm, lasting about a
month. After <i>mbule</i> follow <i>tovaruru</i>, lasting about 2 months,
and <i>sassa nanamo</i>, one month. In Lambutjo the matter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
is still further complicated. The following winds are distinguished:&mdash;south
wind, west wind, good wind at the time
of almond-ripening, lasting about one month. Further the east
wind, strong or quite weak with squalls, not good. Three
months afterwards comes the west wind, lasting about 2&ndash;3
months. After the east wind a south-west wind, very strong,
at that time one cannot sail on the sea: it often comes 5
months after the east wind. After the south-west wind a SE wind,
lasting only 1&ndash;2 weeks. Then strong E wind, lasting 1&ndash;2
months, during which time navigation in canoes is impossible.
Then again a time of ‘clear water’, i. e. calm, lasting two months.
After this, S wind, NW wind, and NE wind. Each of these
lasts only a short time, altogether they occupy 3&ndash;4 months.
Then begins a lighter E wind, lasting 3&ndash;4 weeks. Then about
one month of light W wind, then again stronger E wind for
1&ndash;2 months. Afterwards S wind for 1½-2 months, lighter SE
wind for 1&ndash;2 weeks, and then again stronger E wind for 2&ndash;3
months. At the time of the west wind there is much rain, at
the time of the east wind much sunshine<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>. It is very interesting
to see how accurately primitive peoples observe Nature,
but these are not indications of time. On the Gazelle
Peninsula it has been observed that when the SE monsoon
blows the sun comes up in the east, and when the NW monsoon
blows it rises in the south: the wind comes from the opposite
direction to that in which the sun rises<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE YEAR.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy1">Following the practice of my authorities I have often in the
foregoing pages made use of the expression that the year
is ‘divided’ into so many parts. From a genetic stand-point
this expression is incorrect, because the time-indications, which
relate to a concrete phenomenon of Nature, are older than the
year, and, since they are connected only with the single phenomenon,
are discontinuous or even indefinite. Only through their
union does the complete year arise. Every natural year however
offers on the whole the same phenomena following one another
in definite succession, and thus the circle of the year has its
prototype in Nature herself. Nevertheless the uniting of the
different seasons into a complete year only takes place gradually
by means of a selection, systematising, and regulation of
the seasons. It must be carried out according to a principle&mdash;we
shall see that this is as a rule the lunar reckoning&mdash;but
the occupations of agriculture also serve as a handle. The
present chapter will shew how the uniting of the seasons into
the year is only a late and incomplete development, how originally
the year does not exist as a numerical quantity, the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pars pro toto</i> counting being resorted to, and finally how the
years are not reckoned as members of an era but are distinguished
and fixed by concrete events.</p>

<p>The difficulty of struggling through to the conception of
the year is exemplified by certain peoples who know two seasons
but reckon in half-years without joining them together.
Naturally this happens in the rare case in which there is very
little difference&mdash;or none at all&mdash;between the two halves
of the year. Thus of the Akikuyu of British East Africa it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
reported:&mdash;The equatorial year has no winter or summer.
Its passage is marked by two wet seasons, which occur in what
are our spring and autumn. The planting is done in all cases
at the first commencement of the rains, and harvesting as soon
as the crop has ripened after the cessation of the rain. There
are therefore two seed-times and two harvests in twelve months,
and when the native speaks of a year he means six months<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>.
This is very natural, since by ‘year’ a vegetation-period is often
to be understood: the half-year reckoning however also appears
where a difference between the two seasons does exist. In
Rotuma or Granville Island the inhabitants reckon in periods
of six months or moons. The west monsoon, which blows
from October to April, doubtless serves to distinguish these
seasons: otherwise the difference between the seasons is hardly
perceptible, the island lying near the equator. The half-years
each contain six months, to which the same names are given
in both halves<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>. The people of the Nicobars reckon in monsoon
half-years, <i>shom-en-yuh</i>, the SW monsoon, <i>sho-hong</i>, blowing
from May to October, and the NE monsoon, <i>ful</i>, from
November to April, so that two of these form one of our
years<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>. The half-years are also said to contain seven months
each<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>: in reality they must vary between 6 and 7 months, as
the year varies between 12 and 13. In New Britain (Bismarck
Archipelago) there are monsoon years of five months: the two
intervening periods of the variable winds and of the calms,
each lasting one month, are not counted<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>. It is said that the
Benua-Jahun of the Malay Peninsula have no other division of
the year than the natural one of the north and south monsoons,
each of which they call a ‘wind-year’, <i>satahun angni</i>; however
a word for year, <i>sa taun</i>, is also ascribed to them<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>. In
Bali the year is divided into two seasons or monsoons, each of
which includes six months; since the months of both halves have
the same names it is evident that originally only half-years
existed<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>. The greatest unit of time among the Orang Kubu
of Sumatra is the six-month <i>mussim</i> (season), which is of Malay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
origin<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>. The Samoans have a name for a period of twelve
months, but they formerly reckoned years of six months (<i>tau-sanga</i>);
each of these corresponded to one of the two six-month
periods, the palolo or rainy season and the monsoon season<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>.
The Moanu of the Admiralty Island name the division of the
year according to the position of the sun. When it stands north
of the equator, the season in question is named <i>morai in paiin</i>
(sun of war), since wars are chiefly fought in this season. When
it stands over the equator, the season is called <i>morai in houas</i>
(sun of friendship), the season of friendship and mutual visits.
When the sun turns towards the south, the cooler season begins<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>.
Of the Kiwai Papuans of the islands in the delta of the Fly River
in New Guinea, Torres Straits, Landtman writes to me that he
cannot say if the people are clear whether they reckon in
years or in half-years<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>. The former supposition is really only
supported by the fact that they are aware that the same natural
conditions recur after the lapse of the two half-years.
There is no word for year. On the whole it may be said that
they count only the months, and hardly conceive of so great
a unit as the year, nor even (at least not everywhere) of the
half-year, although there may be a hint of this in special
cases.</p>

<p>Not seldom the dry and the rainy seasons are counted
without being combined into a year. This is expressly stated
of the Tupi of Brazil and certainly applies also to the Bakairi<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>.
In Loango there are dry and rainy seasons, and in many districts
a third season also, the fruit-ripening. Commonly the
people reckon by the two main seasons. A centenarian is
therefore fifty years old<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>. In Uganda there are in the course
of twelve months two rainy and two dry seasons, although
there is hardly a month in which no rain falls at all. The rainy
season from February to June is called <i>togo mukazi</i>, since the
rain then falls without much thunder: the second, from August
to November, is called <i>dumbi musaja</i>, because of the thunder
and the frequent deaths from lightning. The dry season about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
December is more intense than that about June. However
the year, <i>mwaka</i>, is composed of one rainy season together
with the following dry season, and consists of six moons or
months<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>. Their year, corresponding to a half-year, consists of
five moons, and a sixth in which it rains<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>. In north Asia the
common mode of reckoning is in half-years, which are not to
be regarded as such but form each one separately the highest
unit of time: our informants term them ‘winter year’ and
‘summer year’. Among the Tunguses the former comprises
6½ months, the latter 5, but the year is said to have 13
months; in Kamchatka each contains six months, the winter
year beginning in November, the summer year in May; the
Gilyaks on the other hand give five months to summer and
seven to winter. The Yeneseisk Ostiaks reckon and name
only the seven winter months, and not the summer months<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>.
This mode of reckoning seems to be a peculiarity of the
far north: the Icelanders reckoned in <i>misseri</i>, half-years,
not in whole years, and the rune-staves divide the year into
a summer and a winter half, beginning on April 14 and
October 14 respectively. But in Germany too, when it was
desired to denote the whole year, the combined phrase ‘winter
and summer’ was employed, or else equivalent concrete
expressions such as ‘in bareness and in leaf’, ‘in straw and in
grass’<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>.</p>

<p>‘Years’ with less than twelve months are to us the
strangest of phenomena. The Yurak Samoyedes and probably
the Tunguses of the Amur reckon eleven months to the year,
the Kamchadales only ten, of which one is said to be as long
as three<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>. The natives of southern Formosa reckon about eleven
months to the year<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>. The inhabitants of Kingsmill Island,
which lies under the equator, reckon periods of ten months,
which are numbered but, in contradistinction to the other
examples, are reckoned in cycles<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>. In the Marquesas 10 months
formed a year, <i>tau</i> or <i>puni</i>, but the actual year, i. e. the Pleiades
year, was also known<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>The Yoruba reckon in 16-day divisions. Fourteen of these
form their old year, of 224 days, i. e. in former times attention
was paid to the rainy season only. The first thunder was the
signal for the fishers and hunters to come back to their huts
and begin farming again.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> The Toradja of the Dutch East
Indies reckon in moon-months: two to three months however
compose a vacant period in which they do not trouble about
time-reckoning<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>. The Islamite Malays of Sumatra distinguish
<i>tahun basar</i>, the great year, or <i>tahun musin</i>, the year of the
seasons, both reckoned as 12 months, from <i>tahun padi</i>, the
rice-year, which among them counts only eleven months<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>. The
Dusun of British North Borneo have two methods of reckoning
their longest divisions of time. If the native be a hill-man he
will reckon by the <i>taun kendinga</i> or the hill-<i>padi</i> season, six
months from planting to harvest, if a plain-dweller by the <i>taun
tanau</i> or wet <i>padi</i> season, 8 to 9 months<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>. This incomplete
year is therefore a vegetation year in which the vacant period
of no work is simply passed over. In this manner may be
explained the much discussed ten-month year of the Romans<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>,
if it really depends upon old tradition and is not a mere creation
of spurious learning. It is not a cyclical year like ours:
a complete explanation will be given below in the investigation
of the manner in which the years were counted.</p>

<p>It is true indeed of most primitive peoples, as is said
of the Hottentots, that they are well acquainted with the
conception (<em>sic!</em> I should have said rather: the concrete
phenomenon) of the year, <i>guri-b</i>, as a single period of the
seasonal variation, but do not reckon in years in this sense<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>.
That is to say the year is by them empirically given but not
limited in the abstract: above all it is not a calendarial and
numerical quantity. Of the Waporogo it is said:&mdash;Somewhat
more difficult (than the times of day) is the conception of the
year. Only older, more intelligent people have a clear idea of
it, the sowing-time and the rainy seasons constituting their
points of reference. But they too can only reckon up a few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
years (though they certainly do this by counting the seasons,
cp. <a href="#Page_92">below, p. 92</a>), and for the great mass of the people the conception
of the year does not exist<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>. The Bontoc Igorot has no idea
of a cycle of time greater than a year, and in fact it is the rare
individual who thinks in terms of a year<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>. The length of the
year consequently varies. Among the Banyankole it begins
with the first heavy rains and lasts until the next heavy rains,
so that a year may be longer or shorter by a few days: it is
a matter of no consequence whether it is a week or even
three weeks that are taken off or added to the length<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>.</p>

<p>With the agricultural year it is just the same. For the
Dyaks of Borneo the rice-harvest is a main division of the
year (<i>njelo</i>); in September after the conclusion of the harvest
the year is at an end; a definite beginning, a New Year’s
Day, is unknown<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>. The translation of a Ho text runs:&mdash;“When
the inhabitants of the interior begin to cultivate the yam-fields
they begin a new year: when the yams are dug up and the
dry grass is burnt away, a year has passed”<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>. Among the
Thonga the notion of the year (<i>lembe</i>, <i>dji-ma</i>) is extremely
vague: the year begins at two different periods, that of tilling
and that of harvesting the first-fruits. They do not make any
difference between a lunar and a solar year<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>. A very significant
account comes from Dahomey. The word for year does
not denote any definite number of months: the sense is rather
‘to plant maize and eat, to plant it again and harvest it’. At
the end of the harvest the year also is at an end<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>.</p>

<p>Here therefore we have a natural year quite concretely
and empirically given. Chronologically it is of no use nor indeed
is it used: what method is resorted to will be shewn below.
Attention must first be called, however, to an important
point. The purely natural year is a circle which has no natural
division, i. e. no beginning or end, the seasons following upon
each other immediately; not so the agricultural year, which
has both beginning and end. Here therefore there is a natural
point of division, a new year, which appeared in some of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
examples just given, and this is an extremely important point
for time-reckoning. The vacant period between harvest and
sowing presents some difficulty, and so both of these periods
can be used as the beginning, as is done among the Thonga:
otherwise the beginning of the year varies considerably, just
because it can be arbitrarily determined<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>.</p>

<p>The contradiction between length or duration of time and
time-reckoning evidently here becomes apparent. The counting
is not performed by means of these fluctuating empirical years,
but the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pars pro toto</i> method is employed, the years are counted
by a season. As soon as it is said that some event took place
at a definite time of the previous year, or will take place at
some point in the following year, a counting of the years is
thereby implied, although for an enumeration of this kind the
conception of the year is not necessary. When it is said that
something happened at the previous harvest, or will happen at
the next dry season a counting of the years is no less implied,
although seasons are reckoned instead of years, i. e. the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pars
pro toto</i> method is used. Thus it is, in fact, with all primitive
and many highly developed peoples, and that not only when an
event that took place at a definite time is spoken of, but also
where the number of years alone is in question: in the latter
case the reckoning is only performed from a favourite, conventionally
selected season. The statement made for the Hottentots
is significant for the kind of reckoning just mentioned.
They keep in mind the age of their cattle from the calving
and lambing periods<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>. Similarly we are told of the modern
Arabians that the female camel is covered for the first time
when she is four <i>rabi</i> old (<i>rabi</i> = the pasture-season in spring,
when the camel foals), so that she foals in the fifth rabi<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>.</p>

<p>As a basis for the counting either a longer or a shorter
season may serve, or indeed any popular natural phenomenon
of regular annual occurrence. Thus of the Chinhwan of Formosa
it is stated that they have no calendar: they only know
that a new year has come when a certain flower blooms again<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>.
The Paez of Columbia have a word <i>enzte</i>, ‘fishing, summer,
year’, since a great fishing is only engaged in once a year, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
January or February<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>. In the language of the Tupi of S. Brazil
the year is always called <i>akayú</i>, cashew-tree, which blossoms
once a year, and produces a much-prized reniform stone-fruit
which is also often used in the preparation of wine: the word
also means ‘season’. This tree bears fruit only once a year,
whence it comes that the Brazilians reckon their age by the
stones, laying aside one for each year, and keeping them in a
small basket reserved for this purpose<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>. The Algonquin of
Virginia reckoned in <i>cohonks</i>, winters; the name refers to the
wild geese, and shews that these have come back to them so
many times<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>. In medieval Swiss charters time is often reckoned
in <i>louprisi</i>, ‘leaf-fall’; <i>dri</i>, <i>nün louprisi</i> = when the leaves
have fallen three, nine times, etc.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>.</p>

<p>In a later section on the beginning of the year we shall
find that the appearance of a certain constellation, in particular
the Pleiades, gives the signal for the beginning of the
agricultural labour, whence is developed the importance of this
date as the opening of the year. The time between two like
appearances of the same constellation, e. g. between two heliacal
risings, is a year. In this manner the name of the constellation
itself can come to denote ‘year’. In many parts of
S. America the same word means both ‘Pleiades’ and ‘year’<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>.
The inhabitants of the Marquesas call the year of 12 months,
as distinguished from the 10-month fruit-year, by the name of
the Pleiades, <i>mata-iti</i><a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>. How easily this comes to pass is shewn
by a statement made for the Bangala of the Upper Congo.
The culmination of the constellation <i>kole</i> gave the principal
planting-season. This was so familiar to the natives that the
informant used the word <i>kole</i> as equivalent to the word ‘year’<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>.
This is in its very nature a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pars pro toto</i> designation, since
it refers to an annually recurring phase of the stars.</p>

<p>More often the years are reckoned by one of the greater<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
seasons. It is a well-known fact that in Old Norse generally, in
Gothic, and often in Old German and Anglo-Saxon time was
reckoned in winters. We find traces of the same practice in Greek
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χίμαρος</span>, ‘a one-year-old goat’, from the same root as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χειμών</span>,
winter) and in Latin (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bimus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trimus</i> = ‘of two, three years’,
from <i>hiems</i>): poets often reckon in <i>hiemes</i><a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>. It is almost the
rule among all peoples who live under a climate that has a
winter with snow and ice. The Ostiaks reckon in winters,
and so do the Eskimos of Greenland<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> and of the Behring
Straits<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>, and the N. American Indians in general, for instance
the Kiowa<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>, the Pawnee<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>, and the Omaha<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>. The common
method of reckoning is not by the season, ‘the cold time’, but
by the concrete phenomenon that distinguishes it, viz. the snow.
So with the tribes of the N. W. interior<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>, the Hupa<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>, and the
Dakota, who say that a man is so many ‘snows’ old, or that
so many ‘snow-seasons’ have passed since an occurrence<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>.
The Siciatl of British Columbia reckon either by summers, ‘fine
seasons’, or by winters, ‘snows’<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>. For the Algonquin <a href="#Page_93">see p. 93</a>.
In the tropics to reckon by the cold season is rare: the Guarini
of Paraguay however reckon in <i>roi</i>, i. e. ‘seasons of coolness’,
‘winters’<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>, and the Bakongo occasionally by <i>sivu</i>, the cold season,
though more often by <i>mou</i>, ‘season’<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>. The reason for the
reckoning of the years in winters is the same as that for the
counting of the days in nights. Winter is a time of rest, an
undivided whole, which practically becomes equivalent to a
single point: it is therefore more convenient for reckoning than
summer, which is filled up with many different occupations.
In the south of N. America, in the states on the Gulf of Mexico,
where the snow is rare and the heat of summer is the dominant
feature, the term for year had some reference to this
season or to the heat of the sun<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>, e. g. among the Seminole
of Florida the name for the year was the same as that used for
summer<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>. Here the summer is the time of rest, but in Slavonic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
also time is reckoned in summers (<i>leto</i> = ‘summer’, plural
= ‘years’). We may compare here the English expressions
‘a maiden of 18 summers’, etc. The reckoning in springs is
only exceptional. The Basuto word <i>selemo</i> means ‘spring,
ploughing-time, year’<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>. At the southern end of Lake Nyassa
time is reckoned by ‘rains’, i. e. rainy seasons<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>.</p>

<p>Ever since the principal food of man has been the produce
of fruit-trees or the corn, the fruit- and corn-harvests and
the whole period of vegetation in general have been of decisive
importance for his well-being. We have already seen how this
circumstance has left its mark upon the indications of the seasons,
and in the same way the second most important method
of counting years is to reckon by harvests or vegetation-periods.
The fellahs of Palestine still do this. Their usual method is
to reckon from one harvest to another, or, as they put it, ‘from
threshing-floor to threshing-floor’<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>. In modern Arabia rents are
hardly ever reckoned for a whole year, but only until the next
spring, <i>rabi</i>, when the young animals are sold, or, as by the
fellahs, until the next threshing-time, <i>bedar</i>, when the farmer
can realise upon his corn<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>. The Negrito of Zambales determine
the year by the planting or harvesting season, but their
minds rarely go back farther than the last season<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>. In Bavaria
in the Middle Ages the years used to be reckoned in
autumns. The ceremonial reckoning in the Sanskrit ritual texts is
in autumns, Sanskrit <i>çarad</i>, ‘autumn’<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>. The subjects of the Incas
had a word <i>huata</i>, ‘year’, which as a verb meant ‘<i>attacher</i>’: but
the lower classes reckoned in harvests<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>. This is also done in the
district around Mombasa<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>. The Arabs sometimes reckon the
years as e. g. 40 <i>charif</i>, <i>charif</i> being the time of the date-harvest<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>.</p>

<p>We have already spoken of the rice-year in the East
Indian Archipelago as a combination of the agricultural seasons;
the period of vegetation of the rice also serves, although
seldom, for the counting of the year. Among the Toradja the
time needed for a plant to come to its full development up to
maturity is called <i>ta’oe</i>, and <i>santa’oe</i> accordingly means ‘a year<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
ago’. <i>Sampae</i> is the rice-year of six months, but <i>santa’oe</i> has
practically the same meaning, since the rice is the most important
cultivated plant. In general, however, the word is
seldom used as a time-indication, but the years are reckoned
by well-known events (on this see <a href="#Page_99">below, pp. 99 ff.</a>); nevertheless
expressions like the following are heard:&mdash;<i>santa’oe owi</i>, ‘when
last year’s rice-crops still stood on the field’, <i>roeanta’oe owe</i>,
‘two harvests ago’<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>. In the South Sea Islands the bread-fruit
is the most important article of food: the people, as we have
seen, know a time of abundance of food and a time of scarcity.
We are told:&mdash;The Malay word for ‘year’ is <i>taun</i> or <i>tahun</i>.
In all Polynesian dialects the primary sense of <i>tau</i> is ‘a season’,
‘a period of time’. In the Samoan group <i>tau</i> or <i>tausanga</i>,
besides the primary sense of season, has the definite meaning
of ‘a period of six months’, and conventionally that of ‘a year’,
as on the island of Tonga. Here the word has the further
sense of ‘the produce of a year’, and derivatively ‘a year’. In
the Society group it simply means ‘season’. In the Hawaiian
group, when not applied to the summer season, the word keeps
its original sense of ‘an indefinite period of time’, ‘a life-time,
an age’, and is never applied to the year: its duration may
be more or less than a year, according to circumstances<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>. So
far our authority. It seems however to be questionable whether
the original sense is not the concrete ‘produce of the seasons’,
rather than the abstract ‘period of time’. It is significant that
on the Society Islands the bread-fruit season is called <i>te tau</i>,
and the names of the other two seasons, <i>te tau miti rahi</i> and
<i>te tau poai</i>, are formed by adding to this name<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>.</p>

<p>Of great significance are the accurate reports for the
Melanesians. They have no conception of the year as a definite
period of time. The word <i>tau</i> (a Polynesian loan-word), or
<i>niulu</i>, which corresponds most nearly to ‘year’, signifies a
season, and so (now) the space of time between recurring seasons.
Thus the yam has its <i>tau</i> of five moons, from the planting&mdash;when
the erythrina is in flower&mdash;until the harvest,
after the palolo has come and gone. The bread-fruit has its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
<i>tau</i> during the winter months: bananas and cocoa-nuts have
no <i>tau</i>, since they always bear fruit. The notion of the
year as the time from yam to yam, from palolo to palolo, has
been readily received, but it is very doubtful if such a conception
is anywhere purely native<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>. The Melanesians are only
interested in the concrete phenomena of the year, and not in
time-reckoning as such, and therefore do not in practice combine
the period from yam-planting to harvest with that from
harvest to planting to form a year. When it is pointed out,
however, it is quite clear to them that this is a single period
of the variation of the seasons. The Polynesians have themselves
noted this fact, and accordingly the sense of the word
<i>tau</i> has been extended from ‘season’ to ‘year’.</p>

<p>Whether the conception of the year was known in the
Indo-European period is not certain: it is however significant
that all the words for ‘year’ of which the etymology is fairly
certain either refer to the produce of the year&mdash;as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὥρα</span> and
its cognates, and also the word ‘year’ itself, Old Scand. <i>ár</i>&mdash;or
else come from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pars pro toto</i> counting of the year. Thus
the Slavonic <i>leto</i> means ‘summer’ and ‘year’. Sanskrit <i>çarad</i>
means ‘autumn’: that the corresponding Avestic <i>sared</i> means
‘year’ is explained by the fact that the years were reckoned
in autumns. The Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐνιαυτός</span> is unexplained, but in Homer,
in the law of Gortyn, and in the inscription of the Labyades
it has also the little observed sense of ‘anniversary’<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>, which
may be the original sense. Further evidence of the lack of
an acquaintance with the conception of the year is afforded
by the fact that the Germanic peoples render it by periphrases
like ‘winter and summer’, etc.<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pars pro toto</i> counting of the year from shorter or
longer seasons does not however extend beyond the years
immediately following or preceding. It is stated of the tribes
living at the southern end of Lake Nyassa that the years are
reckoned in ‘rains’ up to three or four years: everything beyond
that is <i>kale</i>, ‘some time ago’<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>. In the district around Mombasa,
in periods not exceeding five years, the date is usually fixed by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
the number of harvests which have been gathered<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>. In general
the primitive peoples reckon only where an immediate practical
interest requires them to do so. The Kiwai Papuans have no
word for year, but only for the monsoon periods: they cannot as
a rule state how many years have elapsed since a certain event,
but only whether it took place recently or long ago<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>. The
inhabitants of the islands of the Torres Straits never count
years<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>. Individuals belonging to tribes at a low stage of
civilisation keep no account of their own age. Among the Waporogo
no one can say how old he is<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>. The Edo-speaking tribes
have a calendar, but an enquiry as to the age of a man or
the number of years since a given event will meet with no
answer, or a random one<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>. In Dahomey no negro has the
slightest idea of his age<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>. The Hottentots have no interest in
their own age, but are interested in that of their cattle, which
they reckon by the calving and lambing periods<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>. Few of the
Chinhwan of Formosa know their age<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>. The Negritos of Zambales
have no idea of their age<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>. No Marquesas Islander, no
Oceanian in general, can give either his own age or the time
of any event<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>; even the Maoris do not know their age, although
they know that the man of forty years is older than
the man of thirty<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>. The statements here made obviously refer
to the absolute age of a man, not to the relative age; for
either it is immediately seen or else easily remembered from
childhood who is older and who younger. The Babwende, for
instance, never know how old they are, but do know quite
well who is the oldest<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>. Since the relative age is thus known,
the age of the people and the time of events can be determined
by reference to the speaker’s own relative age or to that
of someone else. On the same page as that from which the
above quotation for the Marquesas Islands is taken, it is stated
that in order to determine the time of any event the people
indicate how tall a person was, or how long his beard was, at
the time when the event took place. The Indians of Pennsylvania<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
temporarily determined an event by referring to their
own age at the time of its occurrence<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>.</p>

<p>From these indications of relative ages there arises of
itself a familiar chronological expedient usually found at the
point where history begins, viz. the reckoning by generations,
which is common e. g. among the Polynesians<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> and in the
older Greek historians. Among the Masai an elaborate system
for classifying ages has exceptionally developed. The circumcision
takes place in four-year periods with intervals of three
and a half years. The circumcisions are known alternately as
‘right-hand’ and ‘left-hand’. Those who have been circumcised
at the same time have a special name, such as ‘those who
fight openly or by day’, ‘those who are not driven away’, etc.;
one ‘right-hand’ and one ‘left-hand’ period combine to form a
generation. The ‘those-who-fight-openly’ period is a ‘right-hand’
period, and those who belong to it were circumcised in 1851&ndash;5;
the ‘those-who-are-not-driven-away’ period is a ‘left-hand’, and
its members were circumcised in 1859&ndash;63. The two periods
or ages together form a generation composed of persons born
from 1834&ndash;1850. Each age has three divisions, first those
known as ‘the big ostrich feathers’, secondly those called ‘the
helpers’, and thirdly those known as ‘our fleet runners’<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>. It
is evident that an excellent basis for the determination of relative
time is hereby given. With time-reckoning <em>per se</em> the
system is not concerned.</p>

<p>Common bases for reckoning are afforded by important
and striking events which have been impressed upon everyone
and are present to all men’s minds: through their relation to
the age of some person they serve as a guide to the chronology.
The Aino, for example, do not count the days, but always refer
to events; if it is asked how old anyone is, the answer will be
that he was born after the catching of the very big fish, or
perhaps in the year when there was so much snow<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>. Here
once more we see how concrete time-indications always precede
the abstract numerical counting of time. And where
numbers are known they are not willingly used, but the year<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
is referred to as one distinguished by a certain noteworthy
event, instead of being regarded as a member of a series.
From a year of this kind the natives can only reckon for a
few years at most in either direction. Where there are many
such noteworthy years the time-relationship is so far recognised
that the succession of the events is known, and perhaps in
certain cases also forms the basis of calculation.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Mombasa wars, famines, the arrival
of white men form epochs of this kind: it is impossible
to detect the age of any adult<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>. It is mentioned that the Toradja
of the Dutch East Indies sometimes reckon nearly approaching
events or events of recent occurrence by the rice-sowing:
dates at a more distant past are indicated by mentioning
events of most note, such as the death of a great man,
an epidemic of small-pox, an important military expedition, a
conclusion of peace, the payment of a tax, etc. The people
do not reckon their own age, but count that of their children,
saying: “When he was born I had my rice-field there, the
next year there”, and so on<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>. It is amusing and at the same
time instructive to note that precisely the same mode of reckoning
was found in Scania at the beginning of the last century.
It was a very common thing, says a well-known authority
on the folk-lore of this district, for a peasant, when asked
how old e. g. his little girl was, to give some such answer as:
“She must be four years old, for she is the same age as my
brown mare, and she was born when our southern field was a
grazing meadow”<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>.</p>

<p>The Batak of Sumatra think that a small-pox epidemic
returns at intervals of from nine to twelve years, and make
use of this belief in reckoning time. On questioning a chief,
says a traveller, how old his house was, I was told: “It has
existed only for two small-pox epidemics”, by which he meant
that it was somewhat more than 24 years old<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>. In Borneo
there have occurred two eclipses of the sun during the last
half-century. The first of these served as a fixed date in relation
to which other events were dated<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>The Eskimos of Greenland knew up to about the twentieth
year how many winters a person had lived, but beyond that
they could not go. Sometimes however they used as epochs
from which to calculate <i>pellesingvoak</i>, ‘the little priest’, i. e.
the arrival of Egede in the country, or the arrival or departure
of other well-known Europeans, or the founding of Godthaab
and other colonies; they would say that this or that person was
born at the coming or departure of such and such a person,
or when eggs were collected, seals caught, etc.<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>.</p>

<p>The Caffres rarely give the proper length of past or future
periods of time, and when they do so the period is never of
more than a few months’ duration. Otherwise it is their custom
to determine the date at which this or that event took place
by reference to a contemporaneous event of greater importance<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>.</p>

<p>The Lapps of Västerbotten reckon their age by the reindeer,
e. g. when this or that <i>aldo</i> (= female with calf) was
born. Formerly they never went farther back in counting than
the previous year. When they had to give the date of an important
event they referred to the time at which some specially
fine female reindeer was born<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>.</p>

<p>The Hottentots, as has been said, have no interest in
their own age, but keep in mind that of their cattle from the
calving and lambing periods. When they wish to date back
somewhat farther, well-known events such as the outbreak of
cattle-plague, hostilities with neighbouring tribes or with the
whites, immigrations, etc. furnish them with satisfactory general
indications from which, coupling them in particular cases
with the birth of their children or the stature of these at the
time, they can arrive at a date<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>.</p>

<p>Where the political development has advanced so far that
a stable monarchy exists, the succession of rulers offers an excellent
means of chronological orientation, and within every reign
certain years can be distinguished by special events. But this
brings us to the beginning of history, and I desist from following
the subject further. One example only:&mdash;The Baganda<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
reckon by the reigns of the kings and by certain wars in one
particular reign. They say ‘It was in the reign of such a king’,
or ‘I was still in arms when such and such a war was fought
in so and so’s reign’<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>.</p>

<p>Where no reigns furnish a system of chronological reckoning,
the concrete references may be systematised until each
year is named and distinguished by a definite event. This was
the practice of the Arabians before Mohammed. Mohammed
is said to have been born in the year of the elephant, or, according
to other sources, some years after the year in which
the viceroy of Yemen marched against Mecca with an army
in which there were elephants<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>. Another year is called the
year of treason or outrage, because certain garments which a
Himjarite king had sent that year to Mecca were stolen,
whence arose a conflict at the feast of pilgrims, in which the
young Mohammed is said to have taken part<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>.</p>

<p>The Wagogo count the years by important events, e. g.
‘the year when the cattle died’, or ‘two years after the building
of Boma (Kilimatinde Station)’<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>. The Masai do not count the
years, but rather denote them by referring to the most important
events that took place in them, e. g. a murrain, a drought,
the death of the chief, an expedition particularly rich in booty,
etc.<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>. A fully developed calendar of this nature is possessed
by the Herero, and has been published from the year 1820<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>.
I give a few years as examples:&mdash;1820, <i>ojo</i> (= year of the)
<i>tjekeue</i>: from the name of the Matabele chief who in 1820 came
to Okahandja with a white peace-ox and made peace with
Katjamuaha. 1842, <i>ojohange</i>, ‘year of peace’, the Nama and
Herero made peace. 1843, <i>ojomaue</i>, ‘year of the stones’: the
Herero as the slaves of Jonker Africander had to build for him
a stone wall; or <i>ojovihende</i>, ‘year of the stakes’: the Herero
had to build a palisade around Jonker’s dockyard. 1844, 1845,
<i>ojomukugu</i> or <i>ojombondi</i>, ‘year of vomiting, of nausea’: the
Nama had poisoned Katjamuaha, and the latter vomited and
purged. And so on up to 1902 inclusive. There are lacking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
only the years 1854, 1855, and, significantly, 1891, 1895, 1899,
and 1900, towards the end: the reckoning fails under growing
European influence. Several years have two descriptions, e. g.
1844 and 1845 (see above); these and 1887&ndash;8 are run together,
the latter as the ‘year of the red murrain among the cows’.</p>

<p>The same mode of reckoning appears, strongly developed
and fixed by the aid of picture-writing, among the Indians of
N. America. Heckewelder says of the Indians of Pennsylvania:&mdash;“They
reckon larger intervals of time by some noteworthy event,
e. g. a very severe winter, a very deep snow-fall, an unusual
inundation, a general war, the building of a new town by the
whites, etc. Thus I have heard more than fifty years ago:&mdash;‘When
their brother Miqaon talked to their fathers they were
so old or so tall, they could catch butterflies or hit a bird with
an arrow’. Of others I have heard that they were born in
the hard winter (1739&ndash;40), or could then do this or that, or
already had grey hair. When they could not refer directly to
any such distinguishing epochs they would say: ‘So many
winters after that’”<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>. This method of reckoning seems to have
existed among the Pawnee at an initial stage. Sometimes
they referred to a year that had been marked by some important
event, e. g. a failure of crops, unusual sickness, a
disastrous hunt: this was referred to as a year by itself, but
after only a few years’ remove this mark became indistinct
and faded away<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>. Among the Dakota and the Kiowa detailed
descriptions were given in picture-writings, which are well-known
and have been published, for the Dakota by Mallery
and for the Kiowa by Mooney. They are painted on buffalo
hide, later also on paper, and represent in painting the history
of the tribe. They were executed by a specially gifted Indian
and were handed down from father to son. When worn out
and obliterated by use they were renewed. In winter they
were often produced before the fire, and the events recounted.
Everyone knew them, however, so that anybody could shew
when he was born or when his father died, and some also
knew the meaning of the pictures. Four copies belonging to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
the Dakota are known, which go back to 1800, 1786, 1775,
and the mythical period, respectively. Every year is denoted
by a picture, without distinction between winter and summer.
Some of the terms used are:&mdash;1794&ndash;5, the ‘Long-Hair-killed’
winter; 1817&ndash;8, the ‘Chozé-built-a-house-of-dead-logs’ winter;
1818&ndash;9, the ‘small-pox-used-them-up-again’ winter; 1821&ndash;2, ‘the
star (meteor)-passed-by-with-a-loud-noise’ winter; 1825&ndash;6, the
‘many-Yanktonais-drowned’ winter (through an inundation);
1833&ndash;4, the ‘storm-of-stars’ winter (so called from the abundance
of shooting-stars), etc. Four Kiowa calendars are known,
one of which is arranged in months, of which it gives 37; two
of the others refer to the years 1833&ndash;93, one to the years
1864&ndash;93. In the first each month is indicated by the crescent
of the moon, and above is the picture characteristic of the
month. The Kiowa annual calendars are clearer than the Dakota
in that they indicate winter by a thick black stroke signifying
that the vegetation has died, and summer by the medicine
lodge with its figures, which form the central feature of the
religious ceremonies of the summer. Above and by the side
of these signs are the pictures, giving the principal events of
the seasons, so that the reckoning of the year becomes the history
of the tribe. The Indians however were also acquainted with
simpler modes of reckoning. Among the Nahyssan of S. Carolina
time was measured and a rude chronology arranged by
means of strings of leather with knots of various colours, like
the Peruvian <i>quipos</i><a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>. The Dakota use a circle as the symbol
of time, a smaller one for a year and a larger one for a
longer period: the circles are arranged in rows, thus: ȱȱȱ
or o-o-o<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>. The Pima of Arizona make use of a tally. The
year-mark is a deep notch across the stick. The records of
early years are memorised, and there are a few minor notches
to aid in recalling them. The year-notches are alike, yet when
a narrator was asked to go back and repeat the story for a
certain year he never made a mistake. Taking the stick in
his hand, he would rake his thumb-nail across the year-notch
and begin:&mdash;‘This notch means etc.’<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>.</p>

<p>The development is clear. Often an important event has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
been impressed upon the memory and now serves as a landmark
from which the few years that it is possible to count are
reckoned. Such events multiply, and when their succession is
known, a longer period can be mastered. Finally the process
is systematised, so that every year has its event (necessarily
even if it be an unimportant one), and is named from that: hence
the reckoning of the years becomes also the history of the
people. This kind of time-reckoning is really used by every one
of us. Whoever looks back over his past life sees chiefly the
more important events, not the dates of the years, and to
these he joins the more peripheral events and so finds his way
in the labyrinth of memory. But we mark the events by the
dates, and thereby obtain an estimation of the course of time,
which is the last acquisition of the human mind in this domain.
The mode of reckoning in question penetrates deeply among
the culture peoples.</p>

<p>The same method of distinguishing the years from one
another was employed in ancient Babylonia, in the days of the
Sumerian kingdom of Ur in the second half of the third millenium
B. C., and also later under the first dynasty in Babylon,
and was only replaced by the reckoning according to the
years of the king’s reign under the dominion of the Kassites<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>.
For our historical knowledge of the events these so-called ‘year-formulae’
are of extreme importance. They vary in each case
according to the towns, and shew that these in some respects
maintained an independent position. The adoption of the
year-formulae of the main locality implies the complete subjugation
of the town<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>. No trace of an era or any reckoning
by the years of the reign is to be found. Only the king’s
accession to the throne is utilised for distinguishing the years,
the first complete year of his reign (not the year of accession,
therefore,) being described as the year of King X. As marks
of the other years the most important national events in the
domain of the religious cult and of politics are almost universally
employed. Only exceptionally is the year named after
some violent natural catastrophe. Rather, it is a striking fact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
that in none of the 66 year-formulae hitherto discovered is
there any mention of an eclipse of the sun, or a comet or meteor.
If no important event has occurred, the year is described
as the one following such and such a year, e. g. the year 49
of king Dungi is called ‘the year in which the temple of X.
was built’; year 50 = ‘the year following that in which the
temple of X. was built’; year 51 = ‘the year following that in
which the temple of X. was built, the year after this’. We
see the clumsy method used in order to avoid counting, instead
of simply saying ‘the second year after etc.’: so firmly
is the concrete description adhered to. These year-formulae
were however used for the dating of documents, and not simply,
as among the primitive peoples with whom we have hitherto
been concerned, for the retaining of past events in the memory.
Hence arises the difficulty that often an event of such importance
that the year can be named after it does not occur until
well on into the year, that is, the event from which the
year is named does not take place until a greater or smaller
part of the year has already passed by. Until the event takes
place indications of the kind already mentioned, having reference
to the preceding year, are employed, e. g. the year 17
of Dungi = ‘the year after that in which the ship of Belit (was
launched)’; when a noteworthy event happens it gives its name
to the year: thus the same year is ‘the year in which the god
Nannar was brought from Kar-zi-da into his temple’. Hence
arise twofold descriptions, and they are indeed necessary in
this kind of designation when events of the current year are
to be dated by the year. An example containing a political event
is the year 36 of Dungi = ‘the year after that in which Simuru
was destroyed’, or ‘the year in which Simuru was destroyed
for the second time’. It is characteristic to count the
destructions of a town but not the years<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>. During the reign
of Rimsin of Larsa, a contemporary of Hammurabi, the years
begin to be run together into an era: there are many datings
from the capture of Isin, up to thirty years after that event,<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
and so under the second king of the first Babylonian dynasty
five years were reckoned after the taking of Kazallu<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>. So
also under the first dynasty of Babylon the years were described
by occurrences, by events in the religious and political
life, especially religious acts and buildings of the kings, by wars,
and lastly by natural catastrophes, especially inundations of
the country<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>. Dates given by events of a previous year are
also found. At that period however the year-formula seems
to have been given at the New Year’s Day and therefore to
have been determined beforehand: when important historical
events occurred, the year was given a new name from these<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>.</p>

<p>In the older period of Egyptian history each year
of the king’s reign is described by an official name borrowed
from the festivals&mdash;e. g. those of the king’s accession, of the
worship of Horus, of the sowing, of the birth of Anubis&mdash;from
buildings, wars, and the censuses for purposes of taxation.
Gradually the simple counting of the years of the reign appears
alongside of these names, and from the end of the old empire
completely supplants the former method even in official dates.
The years however are not calendar years, but begin with the
day of the king’s accession: they therefore offer the disadvantage
of running from different dates according to this. At
certain periods however the reigns, as in Babylon, were counted
only from the first New Year’s Day. Of an era there is
only a single example<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>. The Egyptians also began with the
concrete descriptions, but passed over, at least within the separate
reigns, to the counting of years which is so much more
suitable for a survey of the course of time. The Assyrian designation
of the year after eponyms, <i>limmu</i>, the Greek after archons,
ephors, and other eponymous officials, the Roman after
consuls etc. are no different. For a people with a fully developed
political life and annually changing supreme officials the latter
naturally offer a means of distinguishing the years; the life
was too regular and too well-established for events of such a
decisive nature that they could impress themselves upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
memory of everyone and become available for time-reckoning
to be able to happen to the whole people in smaller intervals
of time. Here however the system shews a weak point. It
is very difficult to keep an arbitrary series of many names in
its right order without confusing the names, and only very
few persons can do it. The system therefore did not provide
that survey over the whole course of time which the awakening
historical sense rendered more and more necessary.
So men were led to the only practical method, that of simply
counting the years and marking them by figures, by which
means everyone without more ado became quite clear as to
the dates of earlier or later events, whether these were expressed
in olympiads, in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ab urbe condita</i> etc., or in the countless
local eras of antiquity. It was long before it was seen that
the starting-point is a matter of indifference, and that the only
essential is that all should use the same starting-point. In this
respect the old reckoning in epochs long continued to influence
the minds of men.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-capy1">The time-indications from the phases of the climate and of
Nature are only approximate: they themselves, like the
concrete phenomena to which they refer, are subject to fluctuation.
Even in the tropics, where the regularity of the climatic
changes is greater than in our latitudes, the beginning of the
rains, the dry season, or monsoons may be to some extent
advanced or retarded. In the temperate zones the fluctuations
are very perceptible. In the year in which I write this (1916)
the corn harvest has been delayed by nearly a month, not only
on account of bad weather in harvest-time but also owing to
the unusually low temperature of the past summer. Even the
townsfolk notice that the days are shorter and the weather is
colder than is usual at the time of harvest. Further, incidents
of plant and animal life&mdash;e. g. the blossoming of certain
trees and plants, the arrival of the migratory birds&mdash;vary
somewhat in different years. In general primitive man takes
no notice of these variations: the Banyankole, for instance, are
indifferent as to whether the year is one or even three weeks
longer or shorter, i. e. whether the rainy season opens so much
earlier or later<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>. The days are not counted exactly, but the
people are content with the concrete phenomenon. More accurate
points of reference are however especially desirable for
an agricultural people, since, although the right time for sowing
can be discerned from the phenomena and general conditions
of the climate, yet a more exact determination of time may be
extremely useful. The possibility of such a determination exists&mdash;and
that at a far more primitive stage than that of the agricultural<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
peoples&mdash;in the observation of the stars, and especially
in the observation of the so-called ‘apparent’ or, more
properly, visible risings and settings of the fixed stars, the importance
of which has already been explained (pp. <a href="#Page_5">5 ff</a>.) The
observation of the morning rising and the evening setting
is extraordinarily wide-spread, but other positions of the stars,
e. g. at a certain distance from the horizon, are also sometimes
observed<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>. The Kiwai Papuans also compute the time
of invisibility of a star. When a certain star has sunk below
the western horizon they wait for some nights during which
the star is ‘inside’; then it has ‘made a leap’, and shews itself
in the east in the morning before sunrise<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>.</p>

<p>Any reader of the classics will be familiar with the risings
and settings of the stars: Virgil, for example, mentions them
often. With him however they are pre-eminently a traditional
ornament of poetic style: the richest sources are the peasants’
rules of Hesiod, in which the stars are mentioned as
time-indications along with phenomena of plant and animal life,
and appear just as frequently as the latter, often in combination
with them. But Homer not only knows several stars but
is also acquainted with the rising and setting. A much quoted
passage in the Iliad runs:&mdash;</p>

<p>The lines refer to the morning rising of Sirius at the beginning
of the fruit-harvest, which about 800 B. C. took place
on the 28th of July (Julian). A modern reader, thinking only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
of the splendour of the star as it shines in the sky at night,
entirely fails to understand the darker and more fateful side of
the simile. Only when it is realised that the time of the morning
rising of Sirius is the time of the greatest heat and sickness,
a period believed to be induced by the rising of this star at
the beginning of the fruit-harvest, is the right idea obtained.
Like Sirius appearing in the sky in the morning twilight of
later summer, Achilles stands out upon the battle-field, eclipsing
all others and bringing destruction to the Trojans<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>. A
difficulty has been found in the passage in that Sirius at his
rising is only just visible and therefore does not shine in his
brightest splendour. But Sirius is for the poet the typical
brightest fixed star, just as he speaks of the heavens as ‘starry’
even when the sun is ascending in them<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>. On every day of
the <i>opōre</i> Sirius rises higher and shines more brightly&mdash;one
must not think only of the actual first rising, the first day of
the star’s appearance. Hence the star becomes the symbol of
the <i>opōre</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀπωρινὸς ἀστήρ</span><a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>. Since it is a star of evil omen it
is also called ‘the disastrous-shining star’<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>. A star-setting is
implied in the words ‘the late-setting Arcturus’<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>. The ‘late’
refers to the fact that the circle which Arcturus describes in
the heavens is great, since he stands so far north. Here belongs
also the observation that the Great Bear alone of the
(greater) stars does not dip down into the ocean<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>. The stars
further serve as a guide to navigation<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And treacherous sleep ne’er fell on the eyes that were watchful still,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For he kept the Pleiads in front, and the Herdman, who slowly doth gain</div>

<p>The Pleiades, the Hyades, and Orion are also mentioned,
but not in any special connexion with the indication of time<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>.
The morning-star helps to determine time on a night journey<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>.</p>

<p>Hesiod says that at the time when the thistle blooms and
the cricket chirps Sirius burns heads and knees<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a>, and that when
the late autumn rains come men feel relieved, since the star
Sirius is not passing over their heads for so long a time but
uses the night more<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>. Commentators of classical times have
indeed here taken Sirius to mean the sun. But wrongly; for
Sirius, whose rising introduces the time of greatest heat, is for
the Greeks the cause of the heat, just as the Pleiades are for
the Australians, and as all stars are held to be the causes of
those climatic changes which are connected with any of their
risings or settings<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>; when Sirius rises earlier, i. e. remains in
the heavens for some hours during the night-time, the heat
declines. The other passages are:&mdash;vv. 564 ff., evening rising
of Arcturus (60 days after the winter solstice, Feb. 24, Julian),
followed by the coming of the swallow, messenger of spring,
before this time the vines should be pruned; vv. 597 ff., the
winnowing of the harvested corn at the morning rising of Orion
(July 9); vv. 609 ff., when Orion and Sirius are in the middle
of the heavens and the dawn sees Arcturus (morning rising
Sept. 18), it is the time of the vine-harvest; vv. 615 ff., at the
(morning) setting of the Pleiades (Nov. 3), of the Hyades, and
of Orion (Nov. 15) it is time to think about sowing; vv. 619 ff.,
when the Pleiades, fleeing from Orion, fall into the sea, storms
rage, and the ship should be drawn up on land. Alcaeus says:&mdash;“Drink
wine, for the star (viz. Sirius) revolves”<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>.</p>

<p>The time-indications from the stars are therefore much
older in Greece than the lunisolar calendar, and always existed
alongside of the latter&mdash;which was of a religious and civil
character&mdash;as the calendar of peasants and seamen, who must
hold to the natural year and its seasons. The watchman who
speaks the prologue of the <i>Agamemnon</i> of Aeschylus says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">“ ... On elbow bent, watching, as ’twere a dog,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I mark the stars in nightly conclave meet.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And those bright constellations, without peer,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lords paramount in heaven, that winter bring</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And summer in their train for mortal men,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Right well I know them as they come and go”<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The discovery of star-observation and of its use in time-reckoning
and navigation is ascribed to the heroes Prometheus
and Palamedes. The latter is regarded by the tragic poets as
the founder of all the elements of intellectual culture, and so
also of the science of the stars<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>. And Prometheus, who glories
in having brought to men every advance in civilisation, includes
therein the knowledge of the risings and settings of the stars:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Of winter’s coming no sure sign had they,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor of the advent of the flowery spring,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of fruitful summer none: so fared through each,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And took no thought, till that the hidden lore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of rising stars and setting I unveiled”<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Later, the phases of the stars have become so familiar
to everyone that Sophocles can say, ‘a time of six months from
spring to Arcturus’, i. e. the morning rising of Arcturus on
Sept. 18<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>.</p>

<p>Whether the Romans made use of time-indications from
the stars before they borrowed them from the Greeks is uncertain;
in any case they had their own names for some constellations:&mdash;<i>vesperugo</i>,
<i>iubar</i> = <i>lucifer</i>, the evening star, <i>septentriones</i>
or <i>iugulae</i>, the Great Bear, <i>vergiliae</i>, the Pleiades.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
<i>Suculae</i>, the Hyades, and <i>canicula</i>, the Dog-star, are translations
of the corresponding Greek names<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>.</p>

<p>At a later period the risings and settings of the stars,
together with the climatic phenomena accompanying them or
believed to accompany them, were brought into a calendar,
which was then arranged according to the signs of the zodiac,
or later according to the months of the Julian or Egyptian
solar year. The Greek lunisolar year was unsuitable for the
purpose, since it varied in reference to the sun and the
stars. How both were adjusted to practical needs is shewn
by the remains of two stone calendars found at Milet. On the
stone are inscribed the risings and settings of the stars, arranged
according to the signs of the zodiac: by the side of these are
holes into which little tablets containing the days of the lunisolar
calendar could be fitted, these tablets being arranged
according to the relation of every lunisolar year to the solar one<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>.</p>

<p>The Arabians also carefully observed the stars, and many
of their proverbs couple the risings of the stars with natural
events<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>. Since these constellations are the so-called lunar
stations their use here is not primitive, but must have been
added on to a primitive usage. The Pleiades were observed
throughout their course, and about most of the positions which
they take up mnemonic verses were made. Mohammed swears
by the setting Pleiades in the 53rd chapter of the Koran.</p>

<p>We return once more to the primitive peoples. It may
be well first to show by a few examples how far they were
acquainted with the stars and saw in them images of terrestrial
things. The Chukchee give names to the most important constellations.
Among divinities are reckoned ‘the Motionless Star’
or ‘the Nail-star’ or ‘the Pole-stuck Star’, the Pole-star, ‘the Front
Head and the Rear Head’, Arcturus and Vega, and <i>pchittin</i>,
a part of Aquilo. Orion is an archer with a crooked back,
who has shot a copper arrow, Aldebaran, against a ‘group of
women’, the Pleiades. His wife is Leo, ‘the Standing Woman’.
Capella is a reindeer-buck which is tied behind the sledge of
a man driving with two reindeer; a fox approaches from the
side. Six of the stars of the Great Bear are men throwing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
with slings, the seventh is a fox gnawing at a pair of antlers.
The Twins are two elks running from two hunters who are
driving two reindeer-teams. Corona is the paw of the Polar
Bear. Delphinus is a seal, Cassiopeia represents five reindeer-bucks
standing in the middle of a river<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>.</p>

<p>The Eskimos of Greenland have a good knowledge of the
stars. The Great Bear is a reindeer, or the little stool on which
they fasten their ropes and harpoons, Aldebaran is the eye of
the bull, the twins are the breast-bone of the heavens, the belt
of Orion is composed of three ‘scattered ones’&mdash;Greenlanders
who were taken up into the sky and could not find their way
back&mdash;Sirius has a man’s name, the Pleiades are to be regarded
as baying hounds with a bear among them, Cygnus as
three kayaks which have been out seal-hunting. Venus is the
follower or man-at-arms of the sun. When one planet crosses
the path of another it is a wife and a concubine who have one
another by the hair, or else it is a visit of two stars<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>. By the
Ammasalik names are given to Vega (‘the Foot of the Lamp’),
which, like the moon, is the brother of the sun, to the Great
Bear, the Pleiades (‘the Barkers’), the belt of Orion, and Aldebaran;
Jupiter is the mother of the sun<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>. Among the Konyag
of the island of Kodiak, off the south coast of Alaska, two
months are named after the risings of the Pleiades and Orion
respectively<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>. Of the Thlinkit it is said that few constellations
or stars appear to have been named by them: those to
which names are given are ‘the Great Dipper’, which by night
used to serve as a guide, the Pleiades (<i>sculpin</i>), ‘Three-men-in-a-line’
(probably the belt of Orion), Venus as the morning star
(‘Morning-round-thing’), and Jupiter (?) as the evening star
(‘Marten-month’ or ‘Marten-moon’). If the morning star comes
up above a mountain south-east of Sitka, it means bad weather,
if well over in the east, good weather<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>. Otherwise the North
American Indians have paid less attention to the stars: but
it is exaggerated to say<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> that the sum-total of their astronomical
knowledge was the ability to point to the Pole-star<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
from which they took their way when they travelled at night,
which however they did unwillingly. The tribes of Pennsylvania
had names for a few stars, and observed their motions:
the Pole-star shewed them by night the direction they must
take in the morning<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>. The Omaha called the Pole-star ‘the
Not-moving-star’, the Pleiades were called by an old name,
‘the Deer’s Head’; this name, which had a religious significance,
was not commonly used, the popular name being ‘Little-duck’s-foot’.
The Great Bear was ‘the Litter’, Venus ‘Big-Star’<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>. For
the Klamath are mentioned only the three stars in the belt of
Orion<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>, for the Biloxi and Ofo ‘Stars-all-heads’ (?) (three large
stars near the Pleiades), ‘Stars-in-circle’ (the Pleiades), and
‘Big Star’, the morning star<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>. The Luiseño of southern California
name the most important stars. The associated stars
form much larger groups than those common among us. The
stars were chiefs among the first people. Those most frequently
mentioned are Antares and Altair. Arcturus is the
right hand of Antares, it rises before the latter and announces
his coming, the other stars around Antares are his suite. Other
chiefs are Spica, Fomalhaut, and the Pole-star. Orion and the
Pleiades are always mentioned together; the latter were seven
sisters, pursued by Aldebaran. The Diegueño constellations
are altogether different from the Luiseño, and are based upon
totally different ideas: it has not been possible however to obtain
an accurate account of them<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>. Of the natives of Guadeloupe
it was reported at their discovery:&mdash;In other places
they merely reckon the day by the sun and the night by the
moon; these women however reckoned by other stars, and
said that when the Great Bear rose or a certain star stood
in the north it was time to do this or that<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>.</p>

<p>The Indians of South America have observed the stars
in much greater detail. The descriptions of von den Steinen
are well known, in particular for the Bakairi of Central Brazil.
Orion is a large frame on which manioc is dried, the larger
stars are the tops of posts, Sirius is the end of a great cross-beam
supporting the frame from the side. The Pleiades are a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
heap of grains of meal that have fallen out at the side: a
larger mass, ‘the father of the heap’, is Aldebaran. Capella
is a little capsule such as the Bakairi wear in their ears, two
other stars of Auriga are the ear-rings of the Kayabi, the
feathers of which are stuck backwards. One star, probably
Procyon, is an ear-piercer, or more properly the hole bored in
the ear. Castor and Pollux are the holes of a great flute.
Canopus has no name. The Southern Cross is a bird-snare on
a twig, and the two large stars of the Centaur represent two
canes belonging to it. In the snare a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mutum cavallo</i> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crax</i>)
was taken, and this could be seen in a dark patch of the
Milky Way close beside. A Sokko heron with a little basket
full of fish corresponds approximately to the stars of Pisces
and Argo. The Scorpion is a drag-net for children, the Milky
Way is a huge drum-stick, and the holes in it (the dark spots)
are observed and explained by stories. The Paressi have a
name for the Southern Cross, above which they see an ostrich
whose figure is to be recognised in a dark spot of the Milky
Way: other animals are also found in the sky. To the Bororo
the Southern Cross represents the toes of a great ostrich,
the Centaur a leg belonging to them, Orion is a Jabuti turtle
and in the parts verging on to Sirius a cayman, the Pleiades
are the bunches of blossom on the angico tree. The name of
Venus was not translatable<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>. The Karaya of Central Brazil
knew many constellations, and drew some of them in our informant’s
sketch-book. The Southern Cross, for example, is a
ray (the fish), the two stars of the Centaur above it represent
an ostrich, upon which a jaguar, Scorpio, is leaping<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>. Of the
natives of Brazil in general it is stated that there is hardly a
single important constellation which does not explain to them
some event, or represent some idea in connexion with things
that happen upon the earth, though they certainly have no
heroes to set in them. Myths of Orion, of the Pleiades, and
of Canopus were related<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>. E. Nordenskiöld has repeatedly
visited the border districts between the Argentine, Bolivia,
and Brazil. Of the Chané and Chiriguano Indians he says that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
they do not give names to many constellations, but they know
them very well. The part of the Milky Way lying nearest to
the Southern Cross is called the Ostrich Way, the Southern
Cross together with a few neighbouring stars is the head of the
ostrich, and the two largest stars of the Centaur are its collar.
Orion with his sword is called ‘Birds-meet-each-other’, another
constellation is ‘the Roe-buck’s Horn’, still another ‘the Tapir’;
the Pleiades are the most important constellation, they are
called <i>yehu</i>, but the natives do not know the meaning of the
name. Venus is called <i>coemilla</i>, ‘morning’. The Guarayu call
Orion ‘the Black Vulture’; at his side lies a heap of snake’s
bones (the sword). The Southern Cross with the stars around
it is an ostrich, the two large stars of the Centaur are a roe-buck,
the Great Bear is a road, a cluster of stars in the south
is ‘the Eel’s Nest’. The Pleiades are called <i>piangi</i>, a word of
unknown meaning; when, on their return after their period of
invisibility, they are surrounded by a circle, it is a good omen:
if the circle is missing, all men will die. Venus is called ‘the
Big Star’<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>. The Karai tribes called α, β Centauri the ostrich’s
feet, the body is the neighbouring ‘coal-pit’ (the dark spot of
the Milky Way), the Southern Cross is a fresh-water ray, the
Pleiades are a flock of parakeets, Orion is the burning roça,
the tail of the Scorpion is called <i>unze</i>. The Ipurina of Rio
Purus call Orion a beetle, the Pleiades a serpent, the Hyades
a turtle, the Cross forest-folk<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>. In a Chilean word-list there
are words for star, constellation, the Pleiades, Orion, planet,
Venus<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>.</p>

<p>In Africa the comparatively more civilised negro Tribes
seem to have paid less attention to the stars than the more
primitive tribes of the south. The Ho tribe considers the stars
to be the children of the moon: it recognises and names the
most important constellations, the morning star (‘the Clucking
Hen’), and the stool-bearer of the moon, a star always situated
in the vicinity of that planet. The Milky Way is composed
of stars forming a cord<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a>. Of the Ibo-speaking tribes we are
told that they seem to be singularly incurious about heavenly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
bodies and occurrences; however names were got for the following
constellations:&mdash;The Pleiades (‘Hen and Chickens’), the
belt of Orion (‘Three and Three’), for the Great Bear two
names not translated were given, Venus (‘the Wise-Man-who-can-talk’)<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>.
In French Guinea η <i>ursae</i> is an ass, and the little
star above it is a thief pursued by the six other stars, members
of the tribe to which the stolen animal belongs. For
other peoples the Great Bear is the star of the camel, Cassiopeia
is that of the ass, the Pleiades have the name ‘murmur’,
i. e. a confused thing. Jupiter (?), the companion and guardian
of the moon, is held in particular veneration. The marabout
in the morning awaits the rising of Venus, and announces by
cries, or sometimes by blows on a gong, the hour of prayer.
Everyone has his good and bad stars, which the magician takes
carefully into account<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>. The intrusion of astrology is not
striking, since the people are Mohammedans, while the names
of the constellations must be of native origin. The Bakongo
call the three stars in Orion’s belt ‘the Dog’, ‘the Palm-rat’,
and ‘the Chief Hunter’; Venus is the wife of the moon. The
people think that the rain comes from the Pleiades, who are
regarded as the ‘Caretakers-who-guard-the-rain’, and if, at the
beginning of the rainy season, this constellation is clearly seen,
they expect a good rainy season, i. e. rain for their farms
without superabundance<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>. The Bangala call the Pleiades a
group of young women; five stars in Lepus, <i>kole</i>, are a man
with head, hands, and feet; the belt of Orion represents three
rowers; five stars in Orion are bundles of thunder and lightning;
the evening star also has a name. From the appearance
of the Milky Way they draw conclusions as to the lack or
abundance of rain; when it is bright and clear there will be
much rain<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>. Ten star-names of the Shilluk are given, but only
two are translated: the Pleiades are ‘the Hen’, and ‘Three
Stars’ is Uranus (<em>sic!</em>). Venus and a fore-runner of Venus are
known<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>. The Wagogo know the Milky Way, the Pleiades, and
the belt of Orion; the western star of the last-named is to
them a boar, the middle star is the dog, and the eastern the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
hunter<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>. Of the Thonga it is further stated that the stars play
a remarkably small part in their ideas. Venus is the best
known, the Pleiades is the only constellation with a name;
they have no notion whatever of constellations, their mind
seems not to have tried to group the stars, or to have seen
figures of animals or objects in the sky<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a>. In Loango the following
constellations are distinguished:&mdash;the false Southern
Cross (‘the Turtle’), the Scorpion (‘the Serpent’), the Pleiades
(‘Ants’), Orion (‘the Fish’), his belt (‘the Line of the Hunter’,
who leads a dog), Sirius (‘the Rain-star’). The natives are
aware that certain stars move; Jupiter is called ‘the Great
Star’, Venus as the evening star is the wife of the moon, as a
morning star she is the liar, spy of the moon, or false moon,
illusory moon<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>.</p>

<p>Far greater knowledge is possessed by the Hottentots,
who know the planets accurately. Venus is ‘the Fore-runner
of the sun’, or the star at whose rising men run away (i. e.
from illicit intercourse), Mercury ‘the Dawn-star’, or the star
that comes when the udders of the cows (which are milked
morning and evening) are filled again: as an evening star he is not
observed. Venus as an evening star is recognised to be the
same celestial body as the morning star, and is called ‘the Evening
Fugitive’, since it does not remain long in the sky. Jupiter
is known, but is sometimes identified with Venus; when however
he is seen in ‘the middle of the sky’ he is called ‘the Middle Star’.
The six stars of the belt and sword of Orion are grouped together
as ‘the Zebras’: δ, ε, ζ are three fugitive zebras against the
middle one of which the hunter ι shoots his arrow θ and <em>c</em>. The
Pleiades, on account of their thick cluster of stars, are called
by a name derived from a verb meaning ‘assemble’, or are
otherwise known as ‘the Rime-star’. The Milky Way is called
‘(glowing) Embers’, the Magellanic Clouds ‘Embers’ in the dual.
Of single fixed stars our author heard only Sirius called by a
name, ‘the Side-star’<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>. The Bushmen divide the stars into
night-stars and dawn-stars: of the latter they relate very fine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
and complicated myths, such as that of the connexion between
‘the Dawn’s Heart’ (Jupiter) and a neighbouring star, his daughter
(Regulus or α <i>leonis</i>). Achernar is ‘the Star-digging-stick’s-stone’,
or ‘the Digging-stick’s-stone of Canopus’; the Pointers to
the Southern Cross are three male lions; α, β, γ <i>crucis</i> are
lionesses; Aldebaran is a male hartebeest, α Orion is a female
hartebeest, Procyon a male eland, Castor and Pollux his wives,
the Magellanic Clouds a steinbok, Orion’s sword three male
tortoises hung upon a stick, his belt three female tortoises so
hung<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>.</p>

<p>The Toda of S. India know the Pleiades, Orion’s sword
(‘the Porcupine-star’), the Great Bear, and Sirius, and relate
about them myths which are probably borrowed from the neighbouring
Badaga<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a>. The pagans of the Malay Peninsula know
the evening and the morning stars, and the stars of the astrological
seasons (<em>sic!</em>), or the Pleiades<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>. In the Indian Archipelago
the observation of the Pleiades as a sign of the arrival of the
season for sowing is very common. Of the Kayan of Borneo
it is stated that though they do not observe the stars or their
movements for practical purposes, they are familiar with the
principal constellations, and have fanciful names for them and
relate mythical stories about the personages they are supposed
to represent. The Klementan call Pegasus ‘the padi store-house’,
the Pleiades are ‘a well’, the constellation to which
Aldebaran belongs is ‘a pig’s jaw’, Orion is a man whose left
arm is missing<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>.</p>

<p>The natives of Australia have a rich stellar mythology<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>.
The evening star has its name and its myths. The Pleiades
are women who in the Alcheringa period lived at Intitakula:
this is believed by all the tribes whom our authority studied.
Orion they regard as an emu, and the stars in general as camp-fires
of natives who live in heaven. As a general rule, however,
the natives appear to pay very little attention to the
stars in detail, probably because these enter very little into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
anything which is connected with their daily life, more especially
with their food-supply. By the northern Arunta and the
Kaitish the Magellanic Clouds are supposed to be full of evil
magic, which sometimes comes down to earth and chokes men
and women in their sleep<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>. According to another author
acquainted with the Arunta the Pleiades are seven maidens
who had danced at the circumcision ceremony and then ascended
into heaven. Two stars in the neighbourhood of the Magellanic
Clouds are called ‘the two Gland-poison Men’: the Clouds
are the smoke of their fires; the dark patch in the Milky Way
is an article of adornment (<i>ngapatjinbi</i>), the Southern Cross
‘an eagle’s foot’. The morning star is also known<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>. The tribes
of S. E. Australia give names to many stars and group some
of them together in constellations, among which are the sons
of Bunjil. The Wiiambo thought that the stars were once
great men. The Southern Cross is an emu, Mars an eagle,
another star is a crow. The Pleiades, according to the Wotjo-baluh,
are some women, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corona australis</i> is ‘the Laughing
Jackass’, a small star in Argo is ‘the Shell Parakeet’<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>.</p>

<p>A very high stage of development in stellar science and
mythology is reached among the Euahlayi tribe of the north-west
district of New South Wales; anyone interested in the catasterisms
of ancient mythology should read the full account given
for this tribe. Venus is called ‘the Laughing Star’&mdash;the reason
for her laughter is a coarse jest&mdash;, the Milky Way is an overflow
of water. The stars are fires which the spirits of the
dead have lit in their journey across the sky, and the dusky
haze&mdash;i. e. presumably the dark patches without stars, which
interest primitive peoples as much as the stars themselves&mdash;is
the smoke of the fires. A waving dark shadow which you
will see along the Milky Way is a crocodile. Two dark spots
in Scorpio are devils who try to catch the spirits of the dead;
sometimes they come down to earth and make whirlwinds.
The Pleiades are seven sisters, ice-maidens; two have been
dulled because a man caught them and tried to melt the ice
off them: they succeeded in escaping to heaven, but do not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
shine so brightly as their sisters. The sword and belt of Orion
are boys who on earth loved and followed the Pleiades, but
after death were turned into stars. In order to remind people
of them the Pleiades drop down some ice in the winter, and it
is they who make the winter thunderstorms. Castor and Pollux
are two hunters of long ago. Canopus is ‘the Mad Star’: he
went mad on losing his loves. The Magellanic Clouds are
‘the Native Companions’, mother and daughter, pursued by
Wurrawilberoo. ‘The Featherless Emu’ is a devil of water-holes,
who goes every night to his sky-camp, ‘the Coal-pit’, i. e.
the dark spot beside the Southern Cross. Corvus is a kangaroo,
the Southern Crown an eagle-hawk, the Cross the first spirit-tree,
a huge <i>yaraon</i> which was the medium for the translation
to the sky of the first man who died on earth. The white
cockatoos which used to roost in the branches of this tree
followed it and became the Pointers<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>.</p>

<p>Ridley has obtained from the former chief of the Gingi
tribe a long series of star-names. Especially noteworthy for
the observation of the risings is the following. The Northern
Crown is called <i>mullion wollai</i>, ‘the Eagle’s Nest’, when it
stands exactly north on the meridian. Altair rises, and is called
<i>mullion-ga</i>, ‘Eagle-in-action’, the eagle springs up to guard his
nest. Later Vega rises, and is also called <i>mullion-ga</i>. The
‘holes’ are also well known. The dark spot at the foot of the
Cross (the <i>zuu</i> tree) is called an emu, the bird sits under the
tree<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>. Elsewhere the star at the head of the Cross is an
opossum fleeing from a pursuer&mdash;the ‘hole’ between the fore-feet
of Centaurus and the Cross<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>.</p>

<p>As to the stellar science of the Melanesians we are very
variously informed. The tribes of the Torres Straits have a
richly developed mythology and observation of the stars<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>.
They distinguish the planets from the fixed stars, at least they
notice that Venus does not twinkle<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>. The Banks Islanders
never travel by night, and consequently do not use the stars in
navigation; in consequence of this, says our authority, no definite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
information about the names of stars or constellations
could be obtained. A native gave a few names, but could not
point out the stars which they were said to denote<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>. The
Moanu of the Admiralty Islands understand the moon and the
stars, but the Matankor know neither stars nor moon<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>. A statement
such as this must be received with great reserve, especially
when it comes from a native of another tribe. In any
case it would constitute an exception, since extremely primitive
tribes know the stars quite well, the natives of New Britain
and of the Solomon Islands even very well. The Pleiades and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corona borealis</i> play an important part (cp. <a href="#Page_141">below, p. 141</a>).
The former are called in Lambutjo <i>kiasa</i>, on the Gazelle Peninsula
‘the People-at-the-feast’, and on Bambatana and Alu the
year is reckoned according to them: the Crown is called in
Lambutjo ‘the Fisher’, in Buin ‘Taro-leaf-greens’, on the Gazelle
Peninsula ‘the Thornback’. Further star-names are:&mdash;for the
Hyades in Buin ‘Earth-rat’, in Lambutjo <i>kapet</i>, a large net for
deep water, on the Gazelle Peninsula <i>kakapepe</i>, a kind of
small fish, the star in the middle of the constellation is called
‘Hog-fish’. Cygnus is called in Buin ‘Hog-bearer’, in Lambutjo
‘the Three Men’. ‘The Dog’ or ‘Shark’ is a large star ‘that
pursues the Fishes’. Many myths are told of the stars<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a>.
Another authority remarks that the natives of the Solomon
Islands are more concerned about the stars than the eastern
Polynesians, perhaps because of their longer sea-voyages. The
possibility of influence from the astronomically learned Polynesians
must also probably be entertained. The people of Santa
Cruz and the Reef Islands excel all others in their practical
astronomy. The natives of Banks Island and the northern New
Hebrides content themselves with distinguishing only the Pleiades,
by which the approach of the yam-harvest is marked, and
with calling the planets <i>masoi</i> from their roundness, as distinct
from <i>vitu</i>, ‘star’. In Florida the early morning star is called
‘the Quartz-pebble-for-setting-off-to-sea’: when it rises later, however,
it is ‘the Shining-stone-of-light’. The Pleiades are ‘the
Company of Maidens’, Orion’s belt is ‘the War-canoe’, the evening<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
star ‘Listen-for-the-oven’ because the daily meal is taken
as evening draws on. All stars are called dead men’s eyes.
At Saa the Southern Cross is a net with four men letting it
down to catch palolo, and the Pointers are two men cooking
what has been caught&mdash;because the palolo appears when
one of the Pointers rises above the horizon. The Pleiades are
called ‘the Tangle’, the Southern Triangle is ‘Three-men-in-a-canoe’,
Mars is ‘the Red Pig’<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>.</p>

<p>The Polynesians are very learned in astronomy, and their
bold and wide sea voyages have helped to make them so, since
in these the stars are their principal guide. The Tahitian, Tupaya,
who accompanied Cook on his first voyage, could always
point out to him the direction in which Tahiti lay<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a>. When
the Society Islanders put to sea in the evening, as was most
commonly the case in their voyages, one constellation, preferably
the Pleiades, was chosen as a point to steer by<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a>. A
detailed report is given for the Marshall Islands:&mdash;In the
journey from atoll to atoll the course of the boat is commonly
directed from a certain passage, island, or promontory to a
passage or promontory of the atoll to be reached. Above
this spot stands the star that gives the direction. It is the
sailor’s business to know for how many hours a star can serve
him as compass, so that immediately after the apparent turning
of the star from east to west he may choose another. Of
great interest also is the idea of the connexion between the
atmospheric and other phenomena and the stars. Certain periods
of bad weather recur every year with tolerable regularity,
so that the sailors attribute them to the immediate influence
of the stars. When, for instance, at 4 o’clock in the morning&mdash;at
which time the signs of the weather are observed&mdash;the
stars stand just above the eastern horizon, they stop up the
east, so to speak, and prevent the free passage of the wind.
But if the pernicious star in question is at the given time 20°
or 30° above the horizon, there is enough space between star and
horizon for the wind to be released. This strong wind will
last until another influential star arises under the first. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
lower star acts like a wind-chute placed against an open hut.
The strength of the wind is therefore reduced. This explains
why every storm is followed by a wind favourable for sailing.
For example when Spica is 20° above the horizon a violent
storm is developed, but this only lasts until Arcturus some
time later becomes visible on the eastern horizon. The most
important of the stars that bring bad weather are Spica, Arcturus,
Antares, the claw of the Scorpion, Altair, Delphinus,
β, μ, λ and γ, ξ, π <i>Pegasi</i>. With the rising of Cassiopeia the time
of calms begins. Jedada (γ, ζ, π <i>aquilae</i>) ‘disembowels the heavens’.
Altair is regarded as a bad fellow. When he rises in the east
before dawn it is commonly a time when food supplies have
run low, so that quarrels arise: only when he rises higher and
the hot season (June-August) brings plenty of food, do reconciliation
and goodwill return. Of ‘King Jäbro’, the Pleiades,
long myths are related: when they emerge from the horizon
joy prevails, but tears are shed when they vanish again into
the west<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>. The knowledge of the stars was often a carefully
guarded secret, but through prevailing European influence it
has now fallen entirely into decay. In Samoa it is now an
exception for a native to know the name of this or that constellation,
since an islander engaged in the fishing trade can
only indicate and name this or that star if it marks the beginning
of some important native occupation<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>.</p>

<p>The Polynesian material for star-names is exceedingly
abundant, and can here only be represented in outline, so as to
give some idea how far astronomy may advance at this stage
of civilisation<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a>. The Marquesas Islanders know and name a
great number of constellations and separate stars, e. g. ‘the
Little Eyes’ (the Pleiades), ‘the Rudder’ (Orion’s belt)<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>. Constellations
mentioned as being known to the Society Islanders
are:&mdash;the Pleiades, Orion’s belt, Sirius (‘Big Star’), the Magellanic
Clouds (the upper and lower ‘Haze’), the Milky Way
(‘the Long-blue-cloud-eating-shark’), Venus, called sometimes
‘Day-star’ or ‘Herald-of-the-morning’, and sometimes ‘Taurna-who-rises-at-dusk’,
Mars (‘the Red Star’), Jupiter, and Saturn<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
The people of Nauru, west of the Gilbert Islands, observe the
stars, chiefly the Pleiades, Orion, Sirius, and the morning and
evening stars<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>. For the Marshall Islands see <a href="#Page_125">above, p. 125</a>. For
Tahiti names are given for Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, the Pleiades
(‘Star-of-the-nest’), Sirius (‘Big Star’), and the belt of Orion,
and it is further stated that many other stars are known by
separate names<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a>. The Hawaiians had names for many constellations,
and they also knew the five planets<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>. An apparently
distinguished native astronomer, named Hoapili, stated that he
had heard from others (Europeans?) that there was one more
travelling-star, but he had never observed it, and was acquainted
only with the five<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>. The Maoris had names for all the
principal stars and for a great number of constellations. The
most important of the latter is ‘the Canoe of Tamarereti’, which
consists of the following parts:&mdash;the three stars of Orion’s
belt form the stern, <i>matariki</i> (the Pleiades) is the prow, <i>te toke o
te waka</i> is the mast, the Southern Cross is the anchor, and the
two Pointers are the cables. Further, Orion’s belt is called
‘the Elbow of Maui’; the Scorpion is ‘the House-of-Te-Whiu-and-his-slaves’;
<i>Waka mauruiho</i> and <i>Waka mauruake</i> are the
husbands of <i>Hurike</i> and <i>Angake</i>, and their daughters are <i>Tioreore</i>
and <i>Tikatakata</i>, the two Magellanic Clouds, whose husbands
are <i>Taikeha</i> and <i>Ninikuru</i>. By the position of the Magellanic
Clouds the natives think they can tell from what quarter
the wind will blow. One constellation is called ‘the Garment
of Maru’, which he let fall as he ascended into heaven. Unfortunately
the names corresponding to our star-map are not
given, and I have omitted many which are not translated<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>.
Some stars are mentioned below in the account of the Maori
calendar of months<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>.</p>

<p>The Micronesians know the stars well; long lists of star-names
come from the Carolines. 18 names are given for Ponape,
among them names for the Pleiades, the Southern Cross, and
the Magellanic Clouds; from Lamotrek come 24, e. g. ‘the Leather-jacket-fish’
(the Southern Cross), ‘the Broom’ (Ursa Minor),
‘the Virile Member’ (Aldebaran), ‘the Body-of-the-animal’ (Sirius),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
‘the Centre-of-the-house’ (Arietes), ‘the Two Eyes’ (Scorpio),
‘the Fowling-net’ (Corona), ‘the Tail-of-the-fish’ (Cassiopeia), etc.;
from Mortlock 23, e. g. (Ursa Minor) <i>fusa-makit</i>, ‘the Seven
Mice’, or it may mean ‘the Star-that-changes-its-position’ (<em>sic!</em>),
Leo, ‘the Rat’, the Southern Cross (perhaps), ‘the Shark’, Delphinus
and Cygnus, ‘the Bowl-in-the-midst-of-Sota’, Sirius, ‘the
Animal’, Orion and Aldebaran, ‘The Branch-of-the-tree’, not
identified, ‘the Fish-net’; from Yap 25, unidentified<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>. The Fijians
on the other hand knew little about the stars. They had no
names even for the most important constellations. The evening
and morning stars were known, under the names of ‘Marking-day’
and ‘Marking-night’, but the natives did not distinguish
between the planets and the fixed stars. Their ignorance is
ascribed to the fact that they never undertake voyages beyond
the limits of their groups, and are bad navigators in the
technical sense, although good sailors<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a>.</p>

<p>Stellar science and mythology are therefore wide-spread
among the primitive and extremely primitive peoples, and attain
a considerable development among certain barbaric peoples.
Although this must be conceded, some people are apt to think
that the determination of time from the stars belongs to a much
more advanced stage: it is frequently regarded as a learned
and very late mode of time-reckoning. Modern man is almost
entirely without knowledge of the stars; for him they are the
ornaments of the night-sky, which at most call forth a vague
emotion or are the objects of a science which is considered
to be very difficult and highly specialised, and is left to the
experts. It is true that the accurate determination of the risings
and settings of the stars does demand scientific work, but
not so the observation of the visible risings and settings. Primitive
man rises and goes to bed with the sun. When he gets
up at dawn and steps out of his hut, he directs his gaze to
the brightening east, and notices the stars that are shining
just there and are soon to vanish before the light of the sun.
In the same way he observes at evening before he goes to
rest what stars appear in the west at dusk and soon afterwards
set there. Experience teaches him that these stars<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
vary throughout the year and that this variation keeps pace
with the phases of Nature, or, more concretely expressed, he
learns that the risings and settings of certain stars coincide
with certain natural phenomena. Here, therefore, there lies
ready to hand a means of determining the time of the year,
and one which is indeed much more accurate than a method
depending on a reference to the phases of Nature. However
it would seem as if this mode of indicating time would require
a greater knowledge of the stars, such as only few peoples
possess,&mdash;as if it would constantly be necessary to observe a
fresh star for each of the smaller divisions of time. This is
not the case, since, as appears from statements already made,
for the purpose of determining the seasons a star may be
observed when it is stationed at other positions in the sky than
on the horizon, e. g., very conveniently, at its upper culmination,
but other positions, expressed by us in so many degrees
above the horizon, may also serve. Just as the advance of the
day is discerned from the position of the sun, so the advance
of the year is recognised by the position of certain stars
at sunrise and sunset. Stars and sun alike are the indicators
of the dial of the heavens. A determination of this kind, however,
is not so accurate as that from the heliacal risings and
settings. Hence the latter pass almost exclusively or at least
pre-eminently under consideration wherever, as in Greece, a
calendar of the natural year is based upon the stars: sometimes
however the upper culmination (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μεσουράνημα</span>) is also
given. Finally the stars can also be observed at other times
of night than just before sunrise or after sunset<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a>: the Marshall
Islanders, for instance, were accustomed to observe the signs
of the weather at 4 a. m. With the lack of a means of accurately
telling the time such an observation is very uncertain
and unpractical, and is therefore seldom found.</p>

<p>In order to determine the time of certain important natural
phenomena it is therefore sufficient to know and observe
a few stars or constellations with accuracy and certainty. The
Pleiades are the most important<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>. It has been asked why this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
particular constellation, consisting as it does of comparatively
small and unimportant stars, should have played so great a
part, and the answer given is chiefly that its appearance
coincides (though this is true of other stars also) with important
phases of the vegetation. This is correct, but something
else must be added. To create constellations in which terrestrial
objects, animals, and men are arbitrarily seen requires
no inconsiderable degree of imaginative power. The Pleiades
however form themselves into a group without any aid from
the imagination, and can without difficulty be recognised as
such. It is because they are easy to recognise immediately
that the observation of these stars plays so important a part.
A similar case is that of the Magellanic Clouds, which, where
they are visible, belong to the best known phenomena of the
heavens, and we may also compare the dark starless patches
which so largely occupy the attention of primitive peoples,
although neither of these two phenomena is used in determining
time, since neither can be observed at the favourable
moment, viz. the twilight.</p>

<p>An account of the Bushmen shews how extremely primitive
peoples may also observe the risings of the stars, may connect
them with the seasons, and&mdash;which is indeed somewhat rare&mdash;may
even worship them. The Bushmen perceive Canopus;
they say to a child:&mdash;“Give me yonder piece of wood that I may
put (the end of) it (in the fire), that I may point it burning towards
grandmother, for grandmother carries Bushman rice; grandmother
shall make a little warmth for us; for she coldly comes out;
the sun shall warm grandmother’s eye for us”. About the same time
as Canopus, Sirius appears, and a similar ceremony takes place.
Sirius comes out: the people call to one another:&mdash;“Ye must
burn (a stick) for us (toward) Sirius.” They say to one another:
“Who was it that saw Sirius?” One man says to the other:
“One brother saw Sirius.” The other man says to him: “I
saw Sirius.” The other man says to him: “I wish thee to burn
a stick for us towards Sirius, that the sun may shining come
out for us, that Sirius may not coldly come out.” The other
man says to his son: “Bring me the piece of wood yonder,
that I may put it in the fire, that I may burn it towards grandmother,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
that grandmother may ascend the sky, like the other
one”, i. e. Canopus. The child brings him the piece of wood,
he holds it in the fire. He points it burning towards Sirius,
he says that Sirius shall twinkle like Canopus. He sings; he
points to them with fire that they may twinkle like each other.
He throws fire at them<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>. Canopus and Sirius appear in winter,
hence the cold is connected with them. The ceremony just
described is obviously a warming-incantation. It is said also
that it will make the stars rise higher, for the higher they stand
above the eastern horizon at sunrise and the more brightly
they twinkle, the more nearly winter draws towards an end.
The Hottentots connect the Pleiades with winter. These stars
become visible in the middle of June, that is in the first half
of the cold season, and are therefore called ‘Rime-stars’, since
at the time of their becoming visible the nights may be already
so cold that there is hoar-frost in the early morning. The
appearance of the Pleiades also gives to the Bushmen of the
Auob district the signal for departure to the <i>tsama</i> field<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a>.</p>

<p>The Euahlayi tribe also connect the Pleiades with the
cold: they call the stars ‘the Ice-maidens’, imagine them to be
covered with ice, and say that in winter they let ice drop on
the earth and also cause the winter thunderstorms<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>. Another
tribe danced in order to win the favour of the Pleiades; the
constellation is worshipped by one body as the giver of rain,
but should the rain be deferred, instead of blessings curses are
apt to be bestowed on it<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>. The Arunta say that the Pleiades
are seven maidens who ascended into heaven, but after many
wanderings came back to Okaralyi, where they again gathered
<i>ugokuta</i> fruit and danced in the women’s dance. During this
period the Pleiades are not to be seen in the sky, i. e. it is
the time between the evening setting and the morning rising.
Here therefore the constellation is connected with a phase of
Nature, and the whole is mythologically explained. According
to another Arunta myth the Pleiades are maidens who had
danced at a circumcision ceremony. After they had taken part
in all the ceremonies in which to-day the assistance of women<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
is still requisite at this festival, they went back to their native
district, whence they ascended to heaven and are now to be
seen as the Pleiades. Not without reason did the circumcision
most frequently take place at the season when the Pleiades
rise at evening in the east and remain in the sky all night
long (this is the case in the summer months), so that this prominent
constellation was regarded as a spectator of the festivities
connected with the rite<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>. The Pleiades therefore serve
to determine the time of the feast, and this circumstance is
again invested with a myth. A tribe of Western Victoria connected
certain constellations with the seasons. The Pleiades are
young maidens playing to a corroboree-party of young men,
represented by the belt and sword of Orion. Aldebaran, ‘the
Rose-crested Cockatoo’, is an old man keeping time for the
dancers. This group corresponds with the months of November
and December. As the year advances Castor and Pollux
appear: they are two hunters who pursue and kill a kangaroo,
Capella. The Mirage is the smoke of the fire at which the
kangaroo is cooked by the successful hunters. Those two groups
set forth the period of the summer. The breaking up of a
prolonged drought is thus explained:&mdash;Berenice’s Hair, which
culminates in March, is a tree with three big branches. When
a shower of rain has come, every drop is nevertheless sucked
up by the dusty earth. A small cavity formed at the junction
of the three branches has however retained a little water, and
here it is imagined some birds drink. The winter stars are
Arcturus&mdash;who is held in great respect since he has taught
the natives to find the pupae of the wood-ants, which are an
important article of food in August and September&mdash;and Vega,
who has taught them to find the eggs of the <i>mallee</i>-hen, which
are also an important article of food in October. The natives
also know and tell stories of many other stars<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>. Another
authority states that they can tell from the position of Arcturus
or Vega above the horizon in August and October respectively
when it is time to collect these pupae and these eggs<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>.
An old chief of the Spring Creek tribe in Victoria taught the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
young people the names of the favourite constellations as indications
of the seasons. For example when Canopus at dawn is
only a very little way above the eastern horizon, it is time to
collect eggs; when the Pleiades are visible in the east a little
before sunrise, the time has come to visit friends and neighbouring
tribes<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a>.</p>

<p>The Chukchee form out of the stars Altair and Tarared
in Aquila a constellation named <i>pchittin</i>, which is believed to
be a forefather of the tribe who, after death, ascended into
heaven. Since this constellation begins to appear above the
horizon at the time of the winter solstice, it is said to usher in
the light of the new year, and most families belonging to the tribes
living by the sea bring their sacrifices at its first appearing<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a>.</p>

<p>Among the N. American Indians the determination of time
from constellations is rare. The Blackfeet Indians regulate
their most important feasts by the Pleiades, a feast is held
about the first and the last day of the occultation of these stars.
It includes two sacred vigils and the solemn blessing and planting
of the seed, and is the opening of the agricultural year<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a>.
According to another legend of the same tribe, the Pleiades
are seven children who ascended into heaven because they
had no yellow hides of the buffalo calves. Therefore the Pleiades
are invisible during the time when the buffalo calves are yellow
(the spring). But when these turn brown, in autumn, the lost
children can be seen in the sky every night<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>. Among the
Tusayan Indians of Arizona the culmination of the Pleiades is
often used to determine the proper time for beginning a sacred
nocturnal rite<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>.</p>

<p>The S. American Indians have much greater knowledge
of the stars, and in consequence frequently connect stellar phenomena,
especially those of the Pleiades, with phases of Nature.
In north-west Brazil the Indians determine the time of planting
from the position of certain constellations, in particular the
Pleiades. If these have disappeared below the horizon, the regular
heavy rains will begin. The Siusi gave an accurate account<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
of the progress of the constellations, by which they
calculate the seasons, and in explanation drew three diagrams
in the sand. No. 1 had 3 constellations:&mdash;‘a Second Crab’,
which obviously consists of the three bright stars west of Leo,
‘the Crab’, composed of the principal stars of Leo, and ‘the
Youths’, i. e. the Pleiades. When these set, continuous rain
falls, the river begins to rise, beginning of the rainy season,
planting of manioc. No. 2 had 2 constellations:&mdash;‘the Fishing-basket’,
in Orion, and <i>kakudzuta</i>, the northern part of Eridanus,
in which other tribes see a dancing-implement. When these
set, much rain falls, the water in the river is at its highest.
No. 3 was ‘the Great Serpent’, i. e. Scorpio. When this sets
there is little or no rain, the water is at its lowest<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>. The natives
of Brazil are acquainted with the course of the constellations,
with their height and the period and time of their appearance
in and disappearance from the sky, and according to
them they divide up their seasons. In the valley of the Amazon
it is said that during the first few days of the appearance
of the Pleiades, while they are still low, birds, and especially
fowls, roost on low branches or beams, and that the higher
the constellation rises the higher the birds roost also. These
stars bring cold and rain: when they disappear the snakes lose
their poison. The canes used for arrows must be cut before
their appearance, or else the arrows will be worm-eaten. The
Pleiades disappear, and appear again in June. Their appearance
coincides with the renewal of the vegetation and of
animal life. Hence the legend says that everything that has
appeared before the constellation will be renewed, i. e. its
appearance marks the beginning of spring<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a>. The Bakairi reckoned
by natural phases, but were also well acquainted with
astronomical signs, and spoke of certain constellations which
reappeared at the beginning of the dry season: they referred
to stars in the vicinity of Orion, ‘the Manioc-pole’<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>. The Tamanaco
of the Orinoco called the Pleiades ‘the Mat’. They
recognised the approach of winter from the signs of Nature<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a>,
but also from the fact that the Pleiades at sunset were not too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
far distant from the western horizon: the evening setting falls at
the beginning of May<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>. The Lengua Indians of Paraguay connect
the beginning of spring with the rising of the Pleiades, and at
this time celebrate feasts which are generally of a markedly
immoral nature<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a>. The Guarani of the same country recognised
the time of sowing by the observation of the Pleiades<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a>. The
Guarayu call the Pleiades <i>piangi</i>; when they disappear the
dry season begins, and when Orion is no longer visible a period
of cold dew begins. The Chacobo of north-eastern Bolivia
regulate the time of sowing by the position of the Pleiades in
relation to the spot where the sun rises<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a>. The Chané and
Chiriguano do the same. When the Pleiades rise above the
horizon very early in the morning, the time for sowing has
come: it is important for this to be finished before the rainy
season sets in<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>. Still further tribes, for which I refer to Frazer,
relate myths about the Pleiades, worship them, and celebrate
feasts at their appearance. So did the inhabitants of
ancient Peru, who called the Pleiades ‘the Maize-heap’<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>. It
might probably be thought that the observation of the Pleiades
has spread from this ancient civilised people among the inhabitants
of S. America, but it is of so primitive a character that
it rather appears to have been one of the rudiments of the
astronomical knowledge of the people of the Incas.</p>

<p>In Africa also the observation of the stars, and above
all of the Pleiades, is wide-spread. In view of the dissemination
of this knowledge all over the world it is making a quite
unnecessary exception to state that it came into Africa from
Egypt. Moreover this assertion does not correspond with the
facts, since among the Egyptians Sirius, and not the Pleiades,
occupied the chief place. The observation of the appearance
of Canopus and Sirius we have already found highly developed
among the Bushmen, that of the Pleiades among the Hottentots.
The Bechuana of Central S. Africa are directed by the
positions of certain stars in the heavens that the time has arrived
in the revolving year when particular roots can be dug<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
up for use, or when they may commence their labours of the
field. This is their <i>likhakologo</i> (‘turnings’ or ‘revolvings’), at
what we should call the spring-time of the year. The Pleiades
they call <i>selemela</i>, which may be translated ‘cultivator’ or ‘the
precursor of agriculture’ (from <i>lemela</i>, ‘to cultivate <em>for</em>’, and
<em>se</em>, a pronominal prefix, distinguishing these stars as the actors).
When the Pleiades assume a certain position in the
heavens it is the signal to commence cultivating their fields
and gardens<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a>. The Caffres determine the time of sowing by
observing the Pleiades<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a>; the Bantu tribes of S. Africa regard
their rising shortly after sunset as indicating the planting-season<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a>.
The Amazulu call the Pleiades <i>isilimela</i>, which has the same
meaning as the Bechuana name, since they begin to dig up
the soil when the Pleiades appear. The people say: ‘<i>isilimela</i>
dies and is not seen’, and at last, when winter is coming to
an end, it begins to appear, one of its stars first and then
three, until, continuing to increase, it becomes a cluster of
stars and is perfectly clearly seen when the sun is about to
rise. Then they say: ‘<i>isilimela</i> is renewed’, ‘the year is renewed’,
and they begin to dig<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a>. Among the Thonga the Pleiades
are the only constellation which bears a name&mdash;<i>shirimelo</i>;
it rises in July and August, when tilling is resumed<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>.
At the southern corner of Lake Nyassa the rising of the Pleiades
early in the evening gives the sign to begin the hoeing
of the ground<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a>. The Kikuyu of British East Africa say that
this constellation is the mark in the heavens to shew the
people when to plant their crops: they plant when it is in a certain
position early in the night. A dancing-song begins:&mdash;“When
the Pleiades meet the moon, the people assemble etc.”<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>
The Masai know whether it will rain or not according to the
appearance or non-appearance of the Pleiades, and the last
month of the period of the great rains, in which their evening
setting falls, is named after them. When they are no longer
visible the people know that the great rains are over, and they
are not seen again until the following season&mdash;the season of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
showers&mdash;has come to an end. The Masai call the sword of
Orion ‘the Old Men’, and his belt ‘the Widows’ who follow
them<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a>.</p>

<p>To the Isubu in Kamerun the constellations, which they
combine in certain groups, shew the course of the seasons; such
constellations are e. g. <i>tole a nyou</i>, the <i>tole</i> of the elephants,
in contradistinction to <i>tole a moto</i>, the <i>tole</i> of men; another is
‘the Orphans’. These are summer signs, they are all found in
the eastern part of the sky<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>. In Sierra Leone the proper time
for planting is shewn by the position in which the Pleiades are
to be seen at sunset: the Bullom do not observe or name any
other stars<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>. The Bakongo associate these stars with the
rainy season: the rain comes from them, they are called ‘the
Caretakers-who-guard-the-rain’<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a>. When the constellation <i>kole</i><a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a>
reaches the meridian, the Bangala plant more than at any
other time, because the rains, though not infrequent, are then
fairly certain<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>. In Loango Sirius is called ‘the Rain-star’, since
as long as he is visible the rains persist. Alongside of him
Orion is regarded as a sign of the rainy season<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a>. In French
Guinea the people know that when the winter constellations
appear above the horizon, indicating that the end of the rains
has come, it is the time of harvest<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a>.</p>

<p>In the Indian Archipelago the observation of the Pleiades
is the most general and frequent means of determining the
time for tillage. Hence these stars are mythologically regarded
as the originators of the rice-culture. The Dyaks of Sarawak
say that Si Jura on a sea-voyage once found a fruit-tree with
its roots in the sky and the branches hanging downwards. He
climbed up into it, and since his comrades sailed away, he
was obliged to climb on and on until he reached the roots and
found himself in a strange land&mdash;the country of the Pleiades.
There Si Kira received him kindly, and invited him to eat.
“Those little maggots?” replied Si Jura. Si Kira answered:&mdash;“They
are not maggots, but boiled rice”, and he explained to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
his guest how the rice was cultivated and reaped, and then
let him down by a long rope near to his father’s house. Si
Jura taught the Dyaks how to cultivate rice, and the Pleiades
themselves tell them when to farm; according to the position
of these stars in the heavens, morning and evening, they cut
down the forest, burn, plant, and reap<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>. In another legend
the Pleiades are six chickens which the hen follows, invisible;
formerly there were seven, and at that time men did not know
of rice, but lived on the products of the forest. One of the
chickens had come down to earth, where men gave it to eat:
it would not eat, however, but brought them a fruit with three
husks, in which there were contained three kinds of rice, that
would ripen in four, six, and eight months respectively. The
hen was angry, and wished to destroy both men and the chicken:
the former were saved by Orion, but only six chickens were
left. During the time in which the Pleiades are invisible, the
hen is brooding, but the cuckoo calls as long as they are visible<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a>.
The Sea-Dyaks determine the time of sowing by observing
the Pleiades. Some tribes determine the approach of
the time of rice-sowing from the observation of the stars. The
Kayan of Borneo know the most important constellations,
although they do not observe them and their motions with a
practical end in view<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a>. However one of the joint authors
just quoted says in another place that although the Kayan more
usually determine the time of sowing by the observation of
the sun, yet both they and many other races in Borneo sow
the rice when the Pleiades at daybreak appear just above the
horizon<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a>. When the time to clear fresh land in the forest
draws near, a wise man is appointed to go out before dawn
and watch for the Pleiades. As soon as they are seen to rise
while it is still dark, the people know that the time has come
to begin work, but not until they are at the zenith before dawn
is it considered desirable to burn the fallen timber and sow rice.
The Dyaks begin the rice-planting when the Pleiades reach
the same position at about 3 or 4 o’clock in the morning as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
the sun reaches at 8 o’clock. Old and experienced men are
on the watch to determine the spot exactly. Then a feast
begins<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a>. The natives of Nias, an island to the south of Sumatra,
assemble to till their fields when the Pleiades appear,
and regard it as useless to do so before that time<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a>. In Sumatra
also the time for sowing was determined in this way.
The Batak of the middle of the island regulate their various
agricultural operations by the position of Orion and the Pleiades.
The Achenese of the north know that the sowing-time has
come when the Pleiades rise before the sun, at the beginning
of July<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>. In northern Celebes the rice-fields are prepared for
cultivation when the Pleiades are seen at a certain height
above the horizon<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a>. The Kai of German New Guinea say that
the time for labour in the fields has come when the Pleiades
are visible above the horizon at night: the Bukaua of the same
country also follow the Pleiades<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a>. When the natives of the
Torres Straits Islands see the Pleiades on the horizon after
sunset, they say that the new yam-time has come<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a>. The
western tribes of these straits have names for many stars,
which are largely grouped into constellations. The seasonal
appearances of certain stars or constellations were noted, and
their rising regulated particular dances, and also, as our authority
thinks, the planting of yams and sweet potatoes<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>.</p>

<p>Accurate information for these tribes is given by Rivers
in the Reports of the Expedition to the Torres Straits. The
most important constellations are ‘the Shark’ (= the Great Bear
together with Arcturus) and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corona borealis</i>. Still larger is
<i>Tagai</i>. This constellation represents a man, Tagai (= Centaurus,
Lupus), standing in the prow of a canoe (Scorpio); in the stern
sits Kareg (Antares). Tagai holds in his left hand (the Southern
Cross) a fishing-spear, in his right (Corvus) some <i>kupa</i>-fruit.
Below the canoe is a sucker-fish, consisting of a part of Scorpio.
<i>Naurwer</i> are ‘the Brothers’&mdash;Vega the elder, and Altair the
younger&mdash;who in their outstretched arms are holding sticks
(β, γ <i>lyrae</i>, β, γ <i>aquilae</i>). In Mabuiag this constellation is called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
<i>Dogai</i>. Our Delphinus is called ‘the Trumpet-shell’, <i>kek</i> is probably
Achernar. Others I omit. The most important star was
<i>kek</i>, whose rising indicated not only the beginning of many
ceremonies but also the planting-season. The risings and settings
of the stars were observed, and certain rites and agricultural
occupations regulated thereby. In Badu it was said that when
only the tail of the Shark is above the horizon, the north-west
wind begins to blow ‘a little bit’: when the tail has gone down
altogether, the people begin to plant yams, and when the Shark
comes up again, yams, sweet potatoes, and bananas are ripe.
The stars also help to determine the seasons. A native of
Mabuiag gave the following list of the stars relating to the
season called <i>aibaud</i>:&mdash;<i>kek</i> comes up, he is the sign for everything
to be done: ‘start meeting’, i. e. at the feasts the holding
of which is dependent upon plentiful supplies of food; <i>gil</i>, <i>usal</i>
(the Pleiades): at this time the ovaries of the turtles enlarge;
<i>pagas</i> and <i>dede</i> (Betelgeuze); <i>utimal</i>; <i>wapil</i>. Towards the end
of the season the Shark becomes visible, and then the pigeon
migrates from New Guinea to Australia, as does the <i>birubiru</i>-bird
when <i>gitulai</i> (the Crab) appears. It is expressly noted
that when the people speak of the rising or setting of a constellation
or star at a certain season, they have in mind the
time of the year when the star or constellation in question
first appears or disappears on the horizon at daybreak. Of
Tagai a catasterism is related which at the same time has
reference to the phenomena of the seasons at the appearance
of the stars in question. On a fishing expedition the crew
stole the water from him and Koang. They therefore killed
them and said:&mdash;“Usal (the Pleiades), you go to New Guinea
side, when you come up there will be plenty of rain. Utimal,
you go to New Guinea side, you have to bring rain. Kwoior,
when you come up over Mangrove Island just before the south-east
monsoon sets in, there will be rain in the morning. Then
the wind will shift and it will rain in the afternoon, and you,
Kek, will come up in the south between Badu and Moa and
it will be cold weather. When you go round this way and
when you come up, then the yams and sweet potatoes will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
ripen. You all have work to do”<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a>. A similar story is told
of the Kiwai Papuans, who have for the most part the same
star-names and call most of their months after stars: the Shark
is also implicated in this story. When the fin sets, there is
more wind and high-water; when the tail sets, more high-water;
when the head rises, the copulating-season of the turtles commences.
Another myth tells how Javagi got angry and threw
Karongo up into heaven, where he and his three-pronged spear
became the constellation Antares<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a>.</p>

<p>The Melanesians of Banks Island and the northern New
Hebrides are also acquainted with the Pleiades as a sign of
the approach of the yam-harvest<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a>. The inhabitants of New
Britain (Bismarck Archipelago) are guided in ascertaining the
time of planting by the position of certain stars<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a>. The Moanu
of the Admiralty Islands use the stars as a guide both on land
and at sea, and recognise the season of the monsoons by them.
When the Pleiades (<i>tjasa</i>) appear at night-fall on the horizon,
this is the signal for the north-west wind to begin. But when
the Thornback (Scorpio) and the Shark (Altair) emerge as
twilight begins, this shews that the south-east wind is at hand.
When ‘the Fishers’ Canoe’ (Orion, three fishermen in a canoe)
disappears from the horizon at evening, the south-east wind
sets in strongly: so also when the constellation is visible at
morning on the horizon. When it comes up at evening, the
rainy season and the north-west wind are not far off. When
‘the Bird’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">canis major</i>) is in such a position that one wing
points to the north but the other is still invisible, the time
has come in which the turtles lay eggs, and many natives
then go to the Los-Reys group in order to collect them. The
Crown is called ‘the Mosquito-star’, since the mosquitoes swarm
into the houses when this constellation sets. The two largest
stars of the Circle are called <i>pitui an papai</i>: when this constellation
becomes visible in the early morning, the time is
favourable for catching the fish <i>papai</i><a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a>. The natives of the
Bougainville Straits are acquainted with certain stars, especially
the Pleiades; the rising of this constellation is a sign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
that the <i>kai</i>-nut is ripe: a ceremony takes place at this season<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>.
On Treasury Island a grand festival is held towards
the end of October, in order&mdash;so far as could be ascertained&mdash;to
celebrate the approaching appearance of the Pleiades
above the eastern horizon after sunset. In Ugi, where of all
the stars the Pleiades alone have a name, the times for planting
and taking up yams are determined by this constellation<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>.
In Lambutjo the year is reckoned according to the position of
the Pleiades. When they are in the east, it is said that ‘they
are waiting’, when at the zenith, ‘they stand in the middle’,
when in the west, they are ‘bowed down’. When they stand
low, the turtles come up on land: the people say that they
‘go to play’, i. e. it is the pairing season. When the Pleiades
are high overhead, the white men celebrate Christmas. When
they ‘come up anew’, the people go to look for fish. At that
time ‘the Fishes’ are in the water. ‘The Fishes’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corona borealis</i>)
dip down when the Pleiades come up. When ‘the
Fishes’ are in the sky, there are no fish in the water. In
both Alu and Lambutjo one division of the year is reckoned
by the return of the Pleiades, another by the almond-ripening.
On the Gazelle Peninsula the time for good fishing is the time
of the appearance of the Pleiades: at this time the fishing-nets
are spread out. It is said that ‘the Thornback’ (Pisces) and
‘the People-at-the-feast’ (the Pleiades) must not see each other;
the former constellation is called <i>galial</i> (‘fishes’), which at this
time are not to be eaten<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a>. On the island of Saa, one of the
Solomon Islands, the Southern Cross is the net with four men
letting it down to catch palolo, and the Pointers are two men
cooking what is caught, since the palolo first comes when one of
the Pointers appears above the horizon<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a>. In the list of star-names
given for the Carolines there are also references to the seasons.
In Ponape <i>le-poniong</i> is seen at the time of the variable winds.
In Lamotrek Corvus is called ‘the Viewer-of-the-taro-patches’,
since he is visible during the taro season; the name of Arcturus
is formed from <i>ara</i>, ‘to conclude’, and <i>moi</i>, ‘to come’, and the
star is so called because his rising indicates the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
north-east winds, which bring visiting parties to the island;
the appearance of Capella means heavy gales and bad weather<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a>.</p>

<p>Among the astronomically learned Polynesians time-estimations
according to stars play an important part: most of
these however belong to the chapters on the months and the
year. In Samoa it is at present an exception if an old fisherman
can indicate and name this or that star which at its entrance
into this or that constellation (<em>sic!</em>) announces the beginning
of an abundant <i>bonino</i>-catch, the immediate return of
the South Sea herring, the <i>atuli</i>, to its accustomed spawning-grounds,
or some other similar event of importance in the life
of the natives<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a>.</p>

<p>When the stars indicate this or that event, the primitive
mind, as so often happens, is unable to distinguish between
accompanying phenomena and causal connexion; it follows that
the stars are regarded as authors of the events accompanying
their appearance, when these take place without the interference
of men. So in ancient Greece the expressions (a certain
star) ‘indicates’ (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σημαίνει</span>) or ‘makes’ (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ποιεῖ</span>) certain weather
were not kept apart, and the stars were regarded as causes
of the atmospheric phenomena<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a>. A similar process of reasoning
is not seldom found among primitive peoples, and a few instances
have already been given, such as the warming-incantation
of the Bushmen against Canopus and Sirius, the name
given to the Pleiades among the Bakongo (‘the Caretakers-who-guard-the-rain’),
and the belief that the rain comes from them,
the myth of the Euahlayi tribe that the Pleiades let ice fall
down on to the earth in winter and cause thunderstorms, in
other words send the rain, and the belief of the Marshall Islanders
that the various positions of certain stars cause storms
or good winds<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a>. The same idea is very clearly seen in the
account of the Hottentots given by a missionary of the 17th
century<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a>. At the return of the Pleiades the natives celebrate
an anniversary: as soon as the stars appear above the eastern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
horizon the mothers lift their little ones in their arms, run up
to some eminence, and shew to them these friendly stars, and
teach them to stretch out their hands towards them. The people
of the kraal assemble to dance and sing according to the old
custom of their ancestors. The chorus is always: “O Tiqua,
our father above our heads, give rain to us that the fruits
(bulbs etc.), <i>uientjes</i>, may ripen and that we may have plenty
of food: send us a good year!”</p>

<p>The natives of Australia (perhaps of Victoria), according
to an old account, worship the heavenly bodies and think that
natural causes are governed by certain constellations. They
have names for these, and sing and dance to win the favour
of the Pleiades, which are worshipped by one group as the
giver of rain; should the rain be deferred, curses instead of
blessings are bestowed on them<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a>. The Euahlayi tribe thinks
that the Pleiades bring frost and winter thunderstorms, and
that the Milky Way by its change of position brings rain<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>.
An old native, chief of the Gingi tribe, when the rain would
not stop, turned to the souls of his dead friends in the Milky
Way with certain charms, until they made the rain cease. The
Milky Way is regarded as a stream with fertile banks<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>.</p>

<p>These facts being so, there is nothing strange in an
account which unfortunately comes from a writer whose evidence
in other respects is open to grave doubt. We are told
that Andy, a native of New South Wales, found the statement
that the sun is the source of heat ridiculous, and said:&mdash;“If
the sun makes the warm weather come in summer-time, why
does he not make the winter warm, for he is seen every day?”
The influence which produces heat, in the belief of the natives,
accompanies the Pleiades. When these are visible at a certain
altitude above the horizon, it is spring, <i>begagewog</i>; when
they rise to their highest altitude, it is summer, <i>winuga</i>; when
in autumn they sink down again towards the horizon, it is
<i>domda</i> (‘autumn’); in winter they are barely visible or are lost
to view altogether; it is then winter (<i>magur</i>), and cold. The
ordinary stars have no kind of influence on the seasons, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
simply the Pleiades<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a>. The account agrees very well with what
is otherwise known of the stellar science of the Australians, and
is perfectly credible. A precisely similar story comes from
the other side of the globe. At the beginning of the 18th century,
when the Lapps were still heathens, one of the questions
which a missionary among these people put to them about their
gods was:&mdash;“Have you prayed the Pleiades to warm the
weather?” In accordance with this a Lapp myth relates that
a servant driven out on a very cold night by a cruel master
was saved by the Pleiades. One of the Lapp names for these
stars, which evidently points to this idea, is ‘the Sheep-skins’<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a>.
The Greeks had the same belief in Sirius as the cause of the
summer heat.<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a></p>

<p>From this belief in the stars as causes of the natural
phenomena it is but a short step to attempt to draw from the
manner of their appearance conclusions as to the kind of
phenomenon caused by them. To the Bakongo the Pleiades
are the guardians of the rain, and when they are clearly to be
seen at the beginning of the rainy season the people expect
a good season, i. e. sufficient but not too much rain<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>. The Nandi
of British East Africa know by the appearance or non-appearance
of the Pleiades whether they may expect a good or a
bad harvest<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a>. The Guarayu of S. America believe that when
the Pleiades at their reappearance are surrounded by a circle,
it is a good omen: but if this circle is wanting, all must die<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>.
In Macedonia the Pleiades are called ‘the Clucking or Brooding
Hen’ (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡ κλωσσαριά</span>); their setting announces the advent
of winter, and from the accompanying conditions omens are
drawn as to the quantity of the forthcoming crop and the fertility
of the cattle. If the constellation sets in a cloudy sky,
this portends a rich harvest<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a>. Similar weather-rules and prognostications
are found in abundance in modern European folk-lore
and in the so-called peasants’ calendars. The origin in
the popular astrological beliefs of antiquity is usually taken
for granted. It is true that astrology, especially under Mohammedan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
influence, has penetrated very deeply even among
little civilised peoples such as the negroes of Central Africa and
the Malays of the Indian Archipelago; but I see no cogent
reason for finding in the above-mentioned world-wide examples
of a belief in the influence of the stars upon natural phenomena
any influence of that astrology which derives from ancient
Babylon. Rather do these myths and traditions seem to
afford an analogy to the initial stages of the Babylonian astrology,
and to shew that the whole vast system of astrology had
its root in primitive thinking. And the Babylonian prognostications
from stars and sky remained, until a very late period,
quite primitive. These observations cannot be followed up
further: astrology and its origins lie outside the limits of the
present study.</p>

<p>It has been shewn, then, that even among the most primitive
peoples of the globe the stars are known, observed,
considered, and used for the determination of time&mdash;the Pleiades,
indeed, first and foremost, but other constellations as well;
of the not nearly so frequent determination of the advance of
night from the motions of the stars we have already spoken
in chapter I. There is however a difference that should not
be neglected between this method of determining time and the
time-indications from natural phases. So far as I have been
able to discover, the stars are never used in a narrative, i. e.
where the date of any familiar event is to be given, but only
where practical rules for the constantly recurring occupations
and labours are concerned, and also for the festivals. The
method therefore does not apply to the historical event in the
wider sense, but only to the reiterated event the recurrence
of which is empirically known. The consciousness of a fixed
and constant order is therefore impressed upon the mind of
primitive man much more powerfully by the eternal revolution
of the constellations than by the variation of the seasons.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE MONTH.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy1">The course of the sun determines the variation between
day and night, and causes the natural phases of the year.
From the position of the sun the times of the day can be
given with ease and certainty, but not so the seasons of the
year,&mdash;to the exceptions I shall recur in chapter XII. From
the fixed stars the hours of the night can be determined, and
still more frequently are the seasons regulated by them. But
this kind of time-determination necessarily refers to points of
time, and not to periods. Only for one or two days has the star
the position which serves for the determination of time. No
division of the year into parts can be carried out by this method,
the most that can be done is to regulate the already
existing divisions by it.</p>

<p>As well as the sun and the fixed stars the moon appears
in the heavens. It does not entirely vanish before the sunlight
like the fixed stars, in the night-time its light eclipses that of
the smaller stars. Its shape, the strength of its light, and the
time of its appearance vary quite perceptibly from day to day.
As long as the human race has existed, man’s attention must
have been drawn to the moon. The course of the moon, thanks
to the rapid revolution of the planet round the earth, forms a
shorter unit, which steps in between day and year. The shorter
interval of time defined by it, unlike the too lengthy period of
the year, is easily kept in mind and taken in at a glance.
This unit has further its peculiar characteristics. In the first
place it has nothing to do with the natural phases conditioned
by the course of the sun: it is in fact incommensurable with
the seasons. In the second place it immediately obtrudes itself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
into notice as a unit. The time-reckoning according to the moon
is in its nature continuous. One moon follows another with a
short interruption, to which at first little attention is paid: for
compared with the 27&ndash;28 days in which the moon can be seen
in the sky the 1&ndash;2 days in which it is invisible are little noticed.
The phases of the moon represent a gradual waxing and
waning, a continuous development. The principle of continuous
time-reckoning is therefore suggested by the moon, in opposition
to the time-indications from natural phases and from the stars.</p>

<p>The observation of the moon is often said to be the oldest
form of time-reckoning. This statement involves a certain
danger, viz. the overlooking of the fact that the time-indications
from natural phases and from the stars&mdash;as I hope has been
shewn above&mdash;are just as primitive and must be just as old.
But if by time-reckoning the continuous principle and measure
of time are implied the statement is in that sense true. The
moon is indeed the first chronometer, and this fact is due to
the nature of its concrete appearance, which draws attention
to the duration, and not to the point, of time. And this, as
always, is the starting-point: practically everywhere the month
as a unit of enumeration or a measure is denoted by the same
word as the moon. The linguistic distinction between ‘moon’
and ‘month’ only follows at a stage which primitive peoples
still living have not yet reached. All peoples know the moon
and use it for time-reckoning. Of the S. American Indians,
who observe the stars so well, it is stated that the month is
everywhere the natural division of time<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a>.</p>

<p>While the human mind therefore arrives only gradually
at the conception of the year, the month is already given by
the natural phenomenon. Consequently it is only to be expected
that it should be expressly stated that the revolution of the
moon determines the greatest measure of time<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a>, and that we
should find peoples who can count reckoning by months and
not by years. Thus, for example, it was often said in southern
Nigeria: “I sold this canoe to him eight moons ago”<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a>. As in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
the counting of the years a well-known event is used as a
starting-point, so it is also with the months. In the New Hebrides
they said:&mdash;“Two moons have gone since this or that
event took place”<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a>. But this principle has not prevailed in the
counting of the months, since it gives too many months in the
course of one human life, and since the months are drawn
into another connexion, to which the following chapter is devoted.
Only in one case is a reckoning of this nature common,
viz. in pregnancy. Examples are superfluous, but I give at
least one:&mdash;The Samoan woman looks at the moon and expects
the beginning of menstruation at a quite definite position
of that planet, each woman naturally having a different position
of the moon in view. If menstruation does not take place then,
she perceives that she is pregnant, and expects her confinement
after ten moon-months<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a>.</p>

<p>No attention is paid at first to the number of days in the
month: many primitive peoples cannot even count so far as
thirty. A significant passage in a Ho text originating from a
native runs:&mdash;“The months are reckoned from the moon (the
same word is used for both), which stands in the sky. When
the moon appears, remains long in the heavens, and then again
for a short time is invisible, we say that a month has just gone.
We know nothing about the number of days constituting a
month. When we see the moon and then it is lost again a
month has gone”<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a>. A native Basuto says that little regard
is paid as to counting the number of days in any month, since
the bulky moon itself fills up the deficiency<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a>. When men begin
to count the days great uncertainty at first prevails: in Buin,
for example, the statements vary between 15 and 31 days<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a>;
the Caffre month is said to have 25 days. Apparently only
the time during which the moon is visible is at first counted.
So it is said of the Caffres that they count the month from the
phases of the moon during its visibility, and that the days of
its invisibility are not counted: the moon has gone to sleep<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a>.
For the Basuto on the other hand only expressions for the
two days of the moon’s invisibility are mentioned: the first,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
‘the moon has gone into the dark’, the second, ‘the moon is
greeted by the apes’, since this animal can see the moon
sooner than man<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a>. The Ibo-speaking peoples also reckon only
28 days to the month<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>, and so do the Dakota<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a>. It is only
natural that the days of the darkness should soon be included,
so that the following month follows directly upon the preceding;
many peoples say, like the Banyankole, that the month lasts
29 days: for 28 days the moon is visible, and for one day
hidden<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>. As always, therefore, the concrete phenomenon is
the starting point. Here, however, not only the varying shape
of the moon, not only its phases, are taken into account, but
also, as in the case of the sun and the stars, its position in
the sky. On the analogy of the rising and setting of the stars
the new moon can be described as the evening setting, the
full moon as the evening rising or morning setting, and the
disappearing of the moon as the morning rising of that planet.
A description of this nature, of course without the above
scientific terminology, does occur, but in isolated instances.
In the above-mentioned Ho text a further passage runs:&mdash;“When
the moon appears and comes nearer, we say ‘it stands
overhead’. After this it stands in the middle (of the sky).
When the moon does not rise until after night-fall we say that
it ‘stands on the edge (of the sky)’. When it does not rise
until very long after night-fall we say ‘it shines unto day-break’.
When the moon is once more on the wane, it will
not be long before another appears.” Other expressions are:&mdash;‘the
moon falls upon the forest’, i. e. stands low on the
horizon, ‘it sleeps in the open air’, when it is in the sky at
day-break<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a>. At the south of Lake Nyassa the day of the
month is denoted by indicating the position of the moon in the
sky at day-break<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a>. Of the Seminole of Florida it is reported
that the months seem to be divided simply into days, and that
the latter are, at least in part, described by reference to the
successive positions of the moon in the sky at sunset. When
our informant asked a native how long he would remain at his
present camp, he answered by pointing to the new moon in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
the west, and sweeping his hand from west to east to the spot
where the moon would be when he should go home. He meant
to answer, “About ten days hence”<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a>.</p>

<p>To indicate the day by the position of the moon in the
sky is however exceptional, and it is just as exceptional for
descriptions of the day according to the position of the moon
to be consistently carried out. The Ewe tribes also have expressions
which refer to the shapes of the moon. These different
shapes have in general attracted most attention, and serve
for time-reckoning. At first the phases of the moon are distinguished
only roughly, but greater and greater refinement
of observation is ever being attained, until every day of the
moon’s revolution is described by a name, and the names not
only refer to the phases of the moon but also indicate its
position in the sky.</p>

<p>Among the different phases of the moon’s light two stand
out with especial prominence&mdash;the first appearance of the
crescent of the new moon in the evening twilight, and the full
moon. Both events are joyfully greeted and celebrated among
many peoples, in particular the appearance of the new moon,
the full moon also, but not so often. The explanation of this
fact must partly lie in the circumstance that the full moon
does not suddenly appear like the new moon, but fills its disc
gradually, so that the days of full moon are more numerous,
instead of being one exactly determined day like the day of
the new moon. Hence there may be a counting of the months
in new moons instead of a continuous reckoning in moons, as
when the natives of the Solomon Islands count the months
which must elapse before the funeral feast by making a notch
in a stick or a knot in a rope at the appearance of the new
moon<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>.</p>

<p>The hailing of the new moon with joy is wide-spread<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a>.
The Dieri of Australia relate that there was once no moon, so
that the old men held a council and a Mura-mura gave them
the moon; in order that they might know when to hold their
ceremonies, he gave them a new moon at certain intervals<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
Heathen Eskimos in West Greenland celebrate at every new
moon a feast with a performance of the sorceror, an extinguishing
of lamps, and the barter of women<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a>. The Patagonians
welcome the new moon by patting their heads and murmuring
an incantation<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a>. Certain tribes of North America at
the eagerly expected appearance of the new moon uttered
loud cries and stretched out their hands towards it<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a>. The
Natchez of Louisiana at every new moon celebrated a feast
which took its name from the principal fruits reaped in the
preceding moon, or from the animals that were usually hunted
then<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>. In the villages of Port Moresby (British New Guinea) the
people at the first sight of the new moon give a prolonged somewhat
shrill cry which is taken up by all and repeated in chorus:
there is no mention of any time-reckoning<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a>. On the southern
side of Dutch New Guinea we learn that the first sight of the
new moon was signalised by a short sharp bark rather than
a shout. Several times on the day following the first sight
of the new moon our authority noticed that a spear decorated
with white feathers was exposed in a conspicuous place in the
village. The author states that he is unable to say whether
this custom had any connection with the calendar<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>. In Buin
at the appearance of the quarter (<em>sic!</em>) of the new moon the
people immediately utter the ‘war-cry’, ‘so that the new moon
may not break the cocoa-nuts’. When the new moon comes
up, the people of Buin trill with their under-lip, plucking at it
with the forefinger and at the same time sending out a high
note (‘<em>a</em>’). In Lambutjo the people howl and strike themselves
on the mouth with their hands, at the same time uttering ‘<em>a</em>’, so
that a kind of quacking is heard. On the Gazelle Peninsula the
natives put their forefingers in their mouths and trill a high
‘<em>u</em>’, the result being a gurgling noise<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a>.</p>

<p>The same custom recurs in Africa. When the Bushmen
catch sight of the new moon they pray:&mdash;“Young Moon!
Hail, Young Moon, hail, hail, Young Moon! Young Moon, speak
to me, hail, hail, Young Moon! Tell me of something! Hail,
hail! When the sun rises, Thou must speak to me, that I may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
eat something. Thou must speak to me about a little thing,
that I may eat. Hail, hail, Young Moon!”<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a>. The Bechuana
watch most eagerly for the first glimpse of the new moon,
and when they perceive the faint outline after the sun has set
deep in the west, they utter a loud shout of <i>kua!</i> and vociferate
prayers to it, e. g. “Let our journey with the white man be
prosperous!”<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>. The Ba-Ronga always greet the apparition of
the new moon with cheers. The first person who sees it shouts
<i>kengelekezee</i> (<i>kenge</i> = ‘half-moon shaped’), and this exclamation
is repeated from one village to another. According to a Nkuma
informant the day of the new moon is <i>shimusi</i>, a day of rest.
The appearance of the crescent was carefully examined. If the
horns were turned towards the earth, this shewed that there
was nothing to fear, the dangers of the month had been poured
out. If the opposite was the case, it shewed that the moon was
full of weapons and misfortunes<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a>. As soon as the new moon is
seen, the Banyankole of Uganda come out of their huts and
clap their hands. Everyone lights a fire in front of his hut and
lets it burn for four days continuously. A number of royal
drums are brought out and beaten without cessation for four
days<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>. The Wadschagga climb a hill in order to see the crescent
properly, and pray at its appearance:&mdash;“One, two, three,
four (the day of the new moon is reckoned as the fourth day
of the month), give me peace, give me food, send me blessing,
and drive want far away. O my moon, break him (my enemy)
neck and throat!” Since in the evening so many curses are
uttered, this day is also termed an evil day. Its peculiarities
decide the character of the whole month. For this reason no
one should go to rest on this evening hungry or only half-satisfied,
or else he will be hungry the whole month long.
The master of the house admonishes his wife:&mdash;“Day of the
moon! Honour the moon, and go in quest of food for the children,
that they may not go to sleep hungry every day.” On
this day no legal business is done and no debts are paid. But
whoever can manage to get his debt paid on that day will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
have luck and his possessions will increase<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>. This custom is of
a highly developed order and exactly resembles the well-known
ancient Roman and modern New Year superstition, in which
moreover the new moon also plays a prominent part; one can
hardly avoid suspecting foreign influence. At Nibo when the
new moon comes out they salute it with:&mdash;“<em>u-u</em>, don’t let
disease catch me, or a bad moon!”; the Ibo celebrate a children’s
festival at the time of the new moon<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>.</p>

<p>The full moon also gives rise to special feasts: half Africa
dances in the light of the nights of full moon. The Bushmen,
for example, never neglected the dance at the time of the
new and full moon. Dancing began with the new moon and
was continued at the full moon<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a>. In Dahomey the festivals
take place at full moon, the days being fixed by the native
government<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a>. This is also the case elsewhere. The people of
Timor on the night of the full moon dance from night-fall till
sunrise: the dancing songs are principally of an erotic character<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a>.
On the Nicobars at new and full moon feasts were celebrated
in which great quantities of an intoxicating beverage prepared
from the juice of the cocoa-palm were drunk<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a>. The Celtic
Iberians of ancient Spain assembled outside their gates on the
nights of full moon and celebrated a feast and danced in honour
of an unknown god<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a>. Who can help thinking here of the
well-known words of Tacitus about the Germans?&mdash;“Their
meetings are, except in case of chance emergencies, on fixed
days, either at new moon or full moon: such seasons they believe
to be the most auspicious for beginning business”<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a>.
A fact is here mentioned to which we shall recur below, viz.
that the feasts and religious festivals are often celebrated during
the time of full moon. This is due not only to the full
light of the moon but also to the world-wide idea that everything
which is to prosper belongs to the time of the waxing moon,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
and above all to the days when it has reached its complete
phase<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>.</p>

<p>New moon and full moon, therefore, by the religious significance
attached to them, prove themselves to have been the
two phases which were first observed. It is certainly no mere
accident that in a word-list of an Australian tribe, the Kakadu
of North Territory, only terms for new moon and full moon
exist (<i>malpa nigeri</i> and <i>mirrawarra malpa</i> respectively)<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a>.
Starting from these two phases, the whole period of the moon
can be divided into two halves, formed by the waxing and the
waning moon. The phases are the same in both halves, but
follow one another in the inverse order. Hence they can be described
by the same word, with an additional word for the
half of the month: but this is only vouched for in one instance,
viz. for the Mendalam Kayan of Borneo<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a>. On the other hand
this division is extremely common, especially among more highly
developed peoples, in the counting of the days of the month,
to which I return below. Quite primitive peoples cannot count
so far as 15, or do so only with difficulty: instead of this they
distinguish still further phases of the moon.</p>

<p>In the next place the crescent of the wasting moon is
added, so that three phases are given: waxing, culmination,
and waning. Thus the Andamanese call the new moon <i>ogur-lo-latika</i>,
the full moon <i>ogur-dah</i>, and the waning moon <i>ogur-boi-kal</i><a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a>.
Another writer gives different names, no doubt for
another tribe:&mdash;New moon = ‘moon-baby-small’, first quarter
= ‘moon-big’, full moon = ‘moon-body’, last quarter = ‘moon-thin’<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>.
The literal translation shews however that this author
wrongly makes these phases equivalent to our quarters; the
full moon and the third quarter are not identical. In reality,
besides the full moon, two phases are distinguished during the
time of the waxing moon, and only one when the moon is on
the wane. The Indians of Pennsylvania distinguish by special
names the new, the round (i. e. the full), and the waning moon:
the last-named they call the half-round moon<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a>. The Negritos<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
of Zambales have periods corresponding to the phases of the
moon: the new moon they call <i>bay’-un bu’-an</i>, the full moon
<i>da-a’-na bu’-an</i>, the waning moon <i>may-a’-mo-a bu’-an</i><a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a>. In
Wuwulu and Aua there were words for the full moon, the
waxing and the waning moon, and for the time of the moon’s
invisibility<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a>. This last is not a phase in the proper sense: as
soon as it was recognised, however, it was natural that it
should be introduced as equivalent to the phases and should
thus complete the circle of the month.</p>

<p>In regard to the further development of the phases it is
to be noted that this does not as a rule take place with any
regularity, but the phases are more specialised during the period
of the waxing than in that of the waning moon. The Karaya
of Central Brazil were overjoyed to note the first appearance
of the crescent. Apparently five phases of the moon are distinguished,
for which our authority obtained the following names
from an Indian:&mdash;First crescent, <i>ahandu loita</i>; not yet quite
full moon, <i>ahandu laläli</i>; full moon, <i>djulum läaläli</i>; last crescent,
<i>ahandu aluläna</i>; new moon, <i>ikona</i>. Of these <i>ahandu laläli</i>
denotes a phase between half and full moon: ‘there are two
moons’. Probably the bright and the dark moon are meant.
This was confirmed for other Indians, but without its being
possible to obtain any accurate account, says our authority.
The theory however fits badly, since the earth-light disappears
in the second quarter, but is very prominent in the first. The
people however were themselves not clear as to the succession
of the phases, they gave different orders and often corrected
themselves<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a>.</p>

<p>The Hottentots call the just emerging, hardly yet perceptible
crescent by a name which means ‘unripe’ and is also
used to denote a premature fruit. The slender shining crescent,
in which the moon as it were ‘revives’, is called by a name
with that significance. The first two quarters have two names
common to both of them, ‘the moon which becomes great or
old’, and ‘the moon which becomes wise’. In the last quarter
only the slender crescent is distinguished: it is called ‘the dying
moon’<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a>. In exceptional cases no name for the full moon is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
given, but we can hardly conclude that such a name was
wanting. An Australian tribe of the North Territory calls the
full moon <i>igul</i>, the half-moon <i>idadad</i>, and the crescent of the
new moon <i>wurdu</i><a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a>. The terminology in Central Australia is far
richer:&mdash;<i>atninja quirka utnamma</i> = new moon, <i>a. q. iwuminta</i>
= half-moon, <i>a. urterurtera</i> = three-quarter moon, <i>a. aluquirta</i>
= full moon<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a>. No terms whatever are given for the waning
moon, but that they were entirely lacking is doubtful, though
it is also to be doubted whether terms for the half and three-quarter
moon cannot also be applied to the waning moon. It
should be noted that in Central Australia, as the words shew,
the new and the full moon are the original phases.</p>

<p>The observation and naming of the phases of the moon
long remain quite unsystematic. The names are mingled with
terms arising from other circumstances. Of the Thonga of
S. E. Africa it is reported:&mdash;When the first quarter appears,
the moon is said to <i>thwasa</i>, a Zulu word which corresponds
to <i>tjhama</i> in Thonga, and is very much used in the terminology
of possessions. Eight days later it is said to <i>basa</i>, to be white
or brilliant; full moon is said to <i>sima</i> or <i>lata batjongwana</i>, to
put the little children to bed, because when it rises it finds
them already sleeping on their mats. The wane is called
<i>kushwela dambo</i>, the moon is then found by the rising sun to
be still in the sky, not having yet dipped below the horizon.
When at last it disappears, it is <i>munyama</i>, the obscurity, the
moon is said to <i>fa</i>, to have died<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a>. The position of the moon
in the sky is also taken into consideration, but not to such an
extent as among the Ewe tribes<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a>; the latter however are also
acquainted with another terminology. Full moon is called ‘the
moon fits’, i. e. nothing of it is wanting, new moon ‘the moon is
dead’. In the first quarter and at the half-moon they say: ‘the
moon is half round’ or ‘falls upon the wood’, i. e. stands low on
the horizon; shortly before full moon ‘the moon is about to become
complete’, ‘is on the increase’; after the full moon ‘the moon is
about to wane’; three days after full moon ‘the moon has cheated
some people’, since it leaves in the lurch those who wish to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
play in the evening; in the last quarter ‘the moon is like the
tail of the cock’ or ‘sleeps in the open’, since it stands in the
sky at day-break<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a>. For the pagan races of the Malay Peninsula
words are given for the new moon, the crescent of the
moon, the half-moon, the end of the waning moon, no moon<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a>.
The Bontoc Igorot of Luzon describe three phases between
full moon and the waning moon, and three between new moon
and full moon, eight altogether therefore, and have special
names for them, but rarely make use of them in time-reckoning<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a>.
The Nabaloi have other words for the same phases, and also
one for the moon showing a rim of light<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a>. The natives of
New Britain (Bismarck Archipelago) observed the phases of
the moon (<i>kalang</i>), and had separate terms for them, e. g.
‘moon not visible’, ‘first quarter of the moon (<em>sic!</em>)’, ‘nearly
full moon’ (in which they hunted for the land-crabs), full moon,
‘beginning to wane’, ‘moon when seen in the morning’, etc.
They also measured time between sunset and moon-rise by the
‘smouldering of a torch’, the time occupied in cooking yams,
taro, and wild taro<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a>. In Buin the crescent as it becomes
visible is first called <i>rubui</i>, ‘the pupil (of the eye) is dead’, since
the whole moon is often to be seen as a dark disc when the
crescent is first formed. Later they say <i>motoguba</i>, ‘a hook is
made’. Still later, <i>nobele</i>, ‘a piece’, ‘a bit’. When the moon’s
disc is full, <i>mairen</i>, ‘it is ripe’ or ‘old’, and <i>roukeu</i>, ‘it is equal’,
i. e. full. When the moon begins to wane, it is called <i>ingom</i>,
‘puffed out’. The ‘puffing out’ becomes weaker, and now the
moon will die, <i>ekio buagi</i>. Throughout the period of the waning
moon the expression used is <i>buan-gubio-eiraubi</i>, ‘it is on the point
of passing away to die’. During the period of the waxing moon
they say <i>(ekio) duabegubi-eiraubi</i>, ‘(the moon) is about to pass
away to the sun(light)-making’. During the time of new moon
they say <i>mamarabui</i>, ‘the great kobold is dead’, or <i>ekio buaguro</i>,
‘the moon is dead’. When it appears again they say <i>ekio rukui</i>,
‘the moon again makes pupils’, i. e. is in the sky. From the
appearance of the moon until the time of new moon they
reckon 25 days. The number however is not always the same,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
but is variously given as 30&ndash;31 days or sometimes as only 15.
It must be supposed that thick clouds often hinder the observation.
The natives count from the rising of the moon<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a>. Of
the tribes of the Torres Straits we are told:&mdash;In Mabuiag
the following descriptions of the phases of the moon are used:&mdash;<i>dang
mulpal</i>, ‘tooth-moon’, since the crescent at its first
appearance is described as unmarried: a little later the moon
is called <i>kisai</i>, and termed young. The half-moon is <i>ipi laig</i>,
‘married person’; the moon in the third quarter is described
as <i>kazi laig</i>, ‘person with child’, and is regarded as having
one child, i. e. presumably as being pregnant; the full moon is
<i>badi</i>, which is said to mean ‘big one married’. In Mer the crescent
of the moon when first observed was called <i>aketi meb</i>,
the moon in the first quarter was <i>meb digemli</i>, in the third
<i>meb zizimi</i>, almost full <i>eip meb</i>, and full moon <i>giz meb</i><a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a>.</p>

<p>Among the tribes of Central Brazil (the Bakairi), as also
elsewhere, the phases of the moon have found mythological
expression. The moon is represented as a shuttle-cock; the
phases start from the full moon. First a lizard comes and
takes hold of it, on the second day an armadillo, and then a
Giant armadillo, whose thick body soon quite covers the yellow
feathers<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a>. The phases are similarly explained among the
Paressi<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a>.</p>

<p>In regard to the more accurate determination of the days
of the moon-month up to the point when each day has its separate
name, it is possible to proceed in two ways, either to
develop more and more elaborately the concrete descriptions
from the phases and positions of the moon, until every day
thus takes its name from the shape or the position of the moon,
or else simply to number the days. The simple counting and
numbering of all the days of the month from the new moon
up to 29 or 30 is the most abstract method, and it is only
found among the most highly developed peoples. Commonly
a mixed system obtains, such, for instance, as that of the
Romans, so that within the month, from the starting-points
offered by the phases, the days of a certain smaller division<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
are counted, or a short phase is distinguished by means of
adjectives in the first, the second, and even the third day of
the phase.</p>

<p>The following may serve as an example of a purely concrete
system. Among the Mendalam Kayan of Borneo the
different days of the period of the moon’s visibility have the
following names in the Busang language (the common commercial
tongue of the Bukau):&mdash;<i>njina</i> (see) <i>dang</i> (pretty well);
<i>matau</i> (eye) <i>dang</i>; <i>lekurdang</i>; <i>butit</i> (belly) <i>halab</i> (tetrodon, a
trunk-fish) <i>ok</i> (little); <i>butit halab aja</i> (big); <i>keleong</i> (body) <i>paja
ok</i>; <i>keleong paja aja</i>; <i>beleling</i> (edge) <i>dija</i>; and <i>kamat</i> (full
moon). The days following have the same names, but in the
inverse order, and with the addition of <i>uli</i>, i. e. to go home.
The days of the moon’s invisibility are not reckoned<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a>. The
days mentioned amount to only 2 × 8; others must therefore
be lacking, or do the names given apply to moon-phases of
more than one day’s duration? The author’s wording seems to
contradict this. The Batak of Sumatra describe the days by
the names of the planets (borrowed from the Sanskrit), repeated
four times. To distinguish one from another they make use
of additions some of which may probably be referred to original
Batak terms<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a>. A complete system exists among the Toradja
of the Dutch East Indies, in connexion with a fully developed
day-superstition such as so often accompanies the moon-month.
On certain days, here distinguished by an asterisk, it
is forbidden to work in the fields: other work is however permitted.
*1, <i>eo mboeja</i>, ‘day of the moon’, from the evening on
which the crescent of the moon was first seen. 2 to 9 have no
special names: they are called altogether <i>oeajoeeo</i>, ‘the eight
days’; the people count <i>ka’isanja oeajoe</i>, ‘the first of the eight’,
or <i>oejoeënja</i>, ‘the beginner’, then the second, the third, etc., and
so on up to <i>kapoesanja oeajoe</i>, ‘the end of the eight’. 10, <i>woeja
mbawoe kodi</i>, ‘the little pig moon’. *11, <i>woeja mbawoe bangke</i>,
‘the great pig moon’; there is a danger that the pigs may break
into the fields. *12, <i>taoe koi</i>, 13, <i>taoe bangke</i>, ‘the little’ and
‘the great man moon’; 14, <i>kakoenia</i>, from <i>koeni</i>, ‘yellow’ (among
the To Pebato <i>sompe</i>, ‘lying’, i. e. on the horizon). *15, <i>togin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
enggeri</i>, from <i>gengge</i>, ‘to run to and fro’ (of animals seeking
food), i. e. one is annoyed by those who run to and fro. *16,
<i>pombarani</i>, ‘the burner’, since the moon in the morning shines
on the house-door; or more rarely <i>pombontje</i>. 17 to 20, <i>wani</i>,
‘dark’. 21, <i>merontjo</i>, among the To Pebato <i>wani of kapoesa mbani</i>,
the last dark day. *22, <i>kawe</i>, ‘to wink’, 23&ndash;25, the second,
third, and last <i>kawe</i>. *26, <i>toe’a marate</i>, ‘the long tree-trunk’
(trunk of a felled tree). 27, <i>toe’a rede</i>, ‘the short stump’, in
the east <i>ojonja saeo</i>, ‘with a day in between’, i. e. until the
vanishing of the moon. 28, <i>polioenja</i>, ‘passing’, i. e. the moon
goes past the sun. 29, <i>soea</i>, ‘going inside’, ‘inside’, because
the moon is then completely inside. Every second month has
30 days; the *30th is called <i>soea ma’i</i>, the <i>soea</i> ‘on this side’,
the second <i>soea</i>. The days are named from the position of the
moon at sunrise, since only the agricultural day is of any importance<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a>.</p>

<p>In Micro- and Polynesia this kind of terminology is best
developed. In Samoa the period of the new moon has few
names; the new moon is called <i>masina pupula</i>, the nights after
this&mdash;when a little of the moon is once more visible&mdash;<i>mu’a
mu’a</i>. On the other hand the days up to and after the
full moon have separate names, and are of importance on account
of the palolo, which is then eagerly sought after. Full moon,
<i>masina ’atoa</i>, ‘full’; 1, night after full moon, <i>masina le’ale’a</i>; 2,
<i>masina fe’etelele</i>; 3, <i>masina atatai</i>, the sea sparkles at the
rising; 4, <i>fana’ele’ele</i>, according to Stair ‘paling tide’; 5, <i>sulutele</i>,
the <i>mali’o</i>-crab is caught with torches (<i>sulu</i>), according to Stair
<i>poolesa</i>, night of the <i>lesa</i>; 6, <i>masina mauna</i>, according to Stair
<i>popololoa</i>, ‘long nights’; 7, <i>masina mauna</i>; 8 (the first palolo-day),
<i>usunoa</i>, ‘wandering about aimlessly’, also called <i>salefu</i>,
since foam (<i>lefu</i>) appears as the first sign of the palolo; 9,
<i>masina motusaga</i> (second palolo-day), <i>motu</i> ‘fragile’, <i>saga</i> ‘continuing’;
10, <i>tatelego</i>, great palolo-day, which may also begin
on the 9th, <i>ta</i> = to fish; 11 (new moon), <i>masina punifaga</i>,
‘only a little covered’; 12, <i>masina tafaleu</i>, ‘little cut away’; 13,
<i>masina tafaleu</i>. The crescent shortly before new moon is called
<i>masina fa’atoaoina</i><a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>In Hawaii the system was very elaborately developed.
The month had thirty days; 17 of these had compound names
(<i>inoa huhui</i>), and 13 had simple names (<i>inoa pakahi</i>). These
names were given to the different nights to correspond with
the phases of the moon. There were three phases&mdash;<i>ano</i>&mdash;,
marking the moon’s increase and decrease of size, (1) the first
appearance of the new moon in the west at evening, (2) the
time of full moon when it stood directly overhead (lit. over
the island) at midnight, (3) the period when the moon was
waning, when it shewed itself in the east late at night. It
was with reference to these three phases of the moon that
names were given to the nights that made up the month<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a>. In
former times there is said to have been a division of the month
into periods of ten days, corresponding to the increase, the
full, and the decline of the moon<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a>. The names of the nights
were:&mdash;1, <i>hilo</i>, ‘to twist’, because the part then seen was a
mere thread; 2, <i>hoaka</i>, ‘crescent’; 3, <i>kukahi</i>; 4, <i>kulua</i>; 5, <i>kukolu</i>;
6, <i>kupua</i>; 7, <i>olekukahi</i>; 8, <i>olekulua</i>; 9, <i>olekukolu</i>; 10, <i>olekupau</i>.
When the sharp points were lost in the moon’s first quarter,
the name of that night was 11, <i>huna</i>, ‘to conceal’; the next,
on its becoming gibbous, was 12, <i>mohalu</i>; 13, <i>hua</i>, ‘egg’; and
when its roundness was quite obvious, 14, <i>akua</i>, ‘God’. The nights in
which the moon was full or nearly so were:&mdash;15, <i>hoku</i>; 16, <i>marealaui</i>;
17, <i>kolu</i>. The night in which the moon’s decrease became
perceptible was called 18, <i>laaukukahi</i>. As it continued to
diminish the nights were called:&mdash;19, <i>olaaukulua</i>; 20, <i>laaupau</i>;
21, <i>olekukahi</i>; 22, <i>olekulua</i>; 23, <i>olepau</i>; 24, <i>kaloakukahi</i>; 25,
<i>kaloakulua</i>; 26, <i>kaloapau</i>; when the moon was very small, 27,
<i>mauli</i>; the night in which it disappeared, 28, <i>muku</i>. This is
Dibble’s list (pp. 24 ff.). Fornander (p. 126) counts in the same
way up to 26, <i>kaloapau</i>, and then continues, 27, <i>kaue</i>; 28, <i>lono</i>;
29, <i>mauli</i>; 30, <i>muku</i>. Malo gives the same names as Dibble,
with the following additions:&mdash;The 15th night had two names.
If the moon set before daylight it was called <i>hoku palemo</i>, ‘sinking
star’, but if, when daylight came, it was still above the
horizon, it was called <i>hoku ili</i>, ‘stranded star’. The second of
the nights in which the moon did not set until after sunrise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
(the 16th) was called <i>mahealaui</i>. When the moon’s rising was
delayed until after the darkness had set in, it was called 17,
<i>kulua</i>, and the second of the nights in which the moon made
its appearance after dark was 18, <i>laau-ku-kahi</i>; the moon had
now waned so much as again to shew sharp horns. The night
when the moon rose at dawn of day was <i>kane</i> (the 27th), and
the following night, in which the moon rose only as the day
was breaking, <i>lono</i> (the 28th). When the moon delayed its rising
until daylight had come, it was called <i>mauli</i> (the 29th),
‘fainting’, and when its rising was so late that it could no
longer be seen for the light of the sun, it was called <i>muku</i>
(the 30th), ‘cut off’. Thus were accomplished the thirty days
and nights of the month. A bare list of the thirty names of
the days is given for the Marquesas<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a>. Alongside of these a
bipartite division of the month is mentioned&mdash;the moon arriving,
and the moon about to be extinguished<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a>. In New Zealand
there are various lists of the nights of the moon. The
month is also sometimes divided into halves according to the
waxing and waning moon<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a>.</p>

<p>I give the Tahitian names in order to point out that here,
as also in Hawaii, some days in the middle of both halves of
the month have the same names, which are distinguished from
the next following by additions the sense of which is unfortunately
not always given. Thus:&mdash;1, <i>tirreo</i>; 2, <i>tirrohiddi</i>; 3, <i>o-hatta</i>;
4, <i>ammi-amma</i>; 5, <i>ammi-amma-hoi</i>; 6, <i>orre-orre</i>; 7, <i>orre-orre-hoi</i>;
8, <i>tamatea</i>; 9, <i>huna</i>; 10, <i>orabu</i>; 11, <i>maharru</i>; 12, <i>ohua</i>; 13,
<i>mahiddu</i>; 14, <i>ohoddu</i>; 15, <i>marai</i>; 16, <i>oturu</i>; 17, <i>ra-au</i>; 18, <i>ra-au-hoi</i>;
19, <i>ra-au-haddi</i>; 20, <i>ororo-tai</i>; 21, <i>ororo-rotto</i>; 22, <i>ororo-haddi</i>;
23, <i>tarroa-tahai</i>; 24, <i>tarroa-rotto</i>; 25, <i>tarroa-haddi</i>; 26, <i>tane</i>;
27, <i>oro-mua</i>; 28, <i>oro-muri</i>; 29, <i>omuddu</i> (28 and 29 together
<i>matte-marama</i>, on the Society Islands they say during these
days that the moon is dead)<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a>. In the islands just mentioned
the names of three successive days are often formed from <i>mua</i>,
‘fore’, <i>roto</i>, ‘in the middle’, and <i>muri</i>, ‘hinder’<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a>, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
Carolines names of the days are similarly combined in groups.
From these lists it becomes plain how the names of the separate
days have been first worked out from the phases of the moon.
When only 29 names are given, the thirtieth day occurring
only in every other month has evidently been left out. This
must be the case, because the month always begins with the
new moon. We further possess lists of the days of the month
for the Mortlock Islands, and some for the Carolines, Ponape,
Yap, Uleai, Lamotrek<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a>; the lists for Lamotrek, Uleai, and the
Mortlock Islands differ only in the dialect. It is to be noted
that in some cases the month falls into smaller subdivisions,
as in Ponape, where it begins after the full moon and consists
of three periods:&mdash;1, <i>rot</i>, ‘darkness’, i. e. nights when there
is no moon, 13 days; 2, <i>mach</i>, new moon, 9 days, which are
numbered consecutively; 3, <i>pul</i>, the time of full moon, 5
days. Three days are therefore lacking (the time of invisibility?).
In Yap 1, <i>pul</i>, new moon, 13 days; 2, <i>botrau</i>, full moon, 9 days;
3, <i>lumor</i>, ‘darkness’, 8 days.</p>

<p>The very fully developed system of the Nandi is curious
in that not the phase but the time of the moon’s rising
chiefly gives the name of the day. 1, ‘the tanners have
seen the moon’; 2, ‘the moon is white’ or ‘new’; 3 and 4, ‘the
moon has cast a light’; 5 and 6, ‘the moon has become
warm’; 7 and 8, ‘the moon has leisure’; 9 and 10, ‘the herdsmen
play in the moonlight’; 11 and 12, ‘the moon is high in the
evening’; 13, ‘the moon turns’; 14, ‘the moon has accompanied
the goats to the kraal’<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a>; 16 (full moon), ‘the moon has passed
along (the heavens)’; 17, (morning) ‘the birds have driven away
the moon’, (evening) ‘the moon has disappeared for a short
while’; 18, ‘the moon has commenced to rise late’; 19 to 21,
‘the moon is late’; 22, ‘the moon has climbed up’ (i. e. stands
high in the heavens in the morning); 23 to 25, ‘the moon is
late up above’; 26 and 27, ‘the moon has turned’ (i. e. goes
towards the west); 28, ‘the moon is nearing death’; 29, ‘the
people discuss the moon’ (discuss whether it is dead), or ‘the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
sun has murdered the moon’; 30, ‘the moon is dead’, or ‘the
moon’s darkness’<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a>.</p>

<p>An example of the naming of smaller groups of days after
the phases of the moon is afforded by the old Arabian names for
the nights of the month<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a>. The nights are grouped in threes,
and are called:&mdash;1&ndash;3, <i>ghurar</i>, ‘the bright ones’; 4&ndash;6, <i>nufal</i>, ‘the
overlapping nights’ (?); 7&ndash;9, <i>tusa’</i>, ‘the nine’; 10&ndash;12, <i>‘ushar</i>,
‘the ten’; 13&ndash;15, ‘the white nights’, lit. <i>‘ajjam al-lajālī l-bidi</i>,
‘the days of the white nights’, the time of full moon; 16&ndash;18,
<i>dura’</i>, ‘the white nights with black heads’, since the moon
does not rise until the night; 19&ndash;21, <i>zulam</i>, ‘the dark nights’;
22&ndash;24, <i>hanadis</i> or <i>duhm</i>, ‘the very dark nights’; 25&ndash;27, <i>da’ādī’</i>,
perhaps after <i>mihaq</i>; 28&ndash;30, <i>mihaq</i>, from <i>mhq</i>, ‘to extinguish’.
The time of the moon’s invisibility, <i>mihaq</i>, consists of the following
days:&mdash;1, <i>ad-da’dja</i>, ‘the black one’; 2, <i>as-sirār</i>,
from <i>srr</i>, ‘to be hidden’; 3, <i>al-falta</i>, ‘sudden event’, ‘attack’.
According to some this last name is used only on the night
before, according to others after, a holy month. This looks
like an attempt to regulate the insertion of the 30th day.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have observed the division of the month into
small and the smallest phases of the moon, in which three or
at most four days have the same name, and are numbered in
order that they may be distinguished. Other peoples count
the days beginning at the principal moon-phases. The Central
Eskimos can determine the days of the month very accurately
from the age of the moon<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a>, the terms are unfortunately
not given. So also for the Kaigan of N. W. America
names of the nights reckoned from the phases of the moon
are quoted; unfortunately only very confused and inaccurate
information could be obtained, and only 14 names are given:&mdash;1,
new moon; 2, ‘second sleep’, etc., up to 9, full moon or
‘great moon’, the third night after which is ‘the first night
after the full moon’<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a>. For the inhabitants of southern Formosa
the bare and therefore almost useless statement is made
that they reckon according to the age of the moon<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a>. Of the
Wagogo of what was formerly German East Africa we are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
told that the phases of the moon and the numbers of the
nights serve as more accurate determinations of time. For
instance, the third night after the next appearance of the moon
will be the day following the third night after the moon’s
appearance, and therefore the fourth of a month, since the
crescent is visible exactly on the first day of a month<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a>. Unfortunately
we are not told what phases, other than the new
moon, serve as starting-points for the reckoning. The same
remark applies to an account for Sumatra. The Central Sumatran
Expedition has proved that names for days of the
week and for months are unknown among the Rawa and the
Djambi Kubu of Djipati Mando. The people count by the phases
of the moon, and say e. g. the 1st, 2nd, 3rd day of the
moon<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>.</p>

<p>These accounts are unfortunately of little use, since they
say too little about the method of the counting. Even when a
complete list of the days or nights of the month does seem
to be forthcoming (the Wagogo, the Kubu), it generally happens
that the counting proceeds from several starting-points,
so that the month is divided up into smaller divisions. This is
natural, since primitive peoples not only possess small capacity
for counting but also prefer to keep the concrete phenomenon
in view. It has already been pointed out that the
counting frequently begins at the two most prominent phases,
the new and the full moon; by this means the month is divided
into the two corresponding halves of the waxing and the
waning moon, or in respect of the appearance or non-appearance
of the moon in the evening and early night into the
light and the dark halves. The difference between these
halves follows from direct observation of nature, and they are
therefore known even to peoples which do not count the days,
e. g. the inhabitants of Buin<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a>, the Germanic tribes, and others.
In Swedish the distinction between <i>ny</i> and <i>nedan</i>, i. e. the
time of the waxing and of the waning moon, is still known.
The Masai, besides a full list of the days of the month, have
a second reckoning according to the light and the dark halves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
of the month<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a>. The Hindus and the civilised peoples of S.
E. Asia reckon in the same way: of these systems of time-reckoning
the Hindu has exercised a powerful influence. Avesta
shews the same reckoning. In the old Gallic calendar of
Coligny each month is divided into two sharply distinguished
halves. The Romans indeed, in the form of their calendar
known to us, reckoned so many days before the Kalends (the
first day of the month), the Nones (the 5th or 7th), and the
Ides (the 13th or 15th), but before their calendar settled into
its curious and quite irrational historic form the <i>Kalendae</i>
must have been the day of the new moon, which was publicly
proclaimed, and the <i>Idus</i> the day of full moon. The <i>Nonae</i>
are secondary: the word simply means the ninth (day), i. e.
before the Ides, which position the day occupies in the inclusive
reckoning employed. The Greek reckoning in decades is
well-known, but in earlier times a bipartite division of the
month appears. Homer divides the month into <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱστάμενος</span> and
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φθίνων</span> (‘rising’ and ‘fading’), Hesiod once mentions a ‘thirteenth
day of the rising moon’<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a>.</p>

<p>We have seen above how to the phases of the new and
the full moon that of the waning moon is added as a third.
When the gradual development of the moon is regarded&mdash;as
is done when numbers are used&mdash;and not the particular
shape of it appearing on a certain day, we also get three periods,
since between the waxing and the waning occurs the
full moon, and this, although not in the strictest sense, lasts
longer than a day, and unlike the waxing and the waning
moon remains in the sky the whole night long. The time of
full moon therefore appears as a third independent period
between the waxing and the waning. The impulse to a tripartite
division hereby given clashed with the decimal system of
enumeration of most peoples; as a rule the counting was
suspended at the basal series of numbers. In this manner we
may account for the not uncommon phenomenon that only ten
months are numbered, the two others being called by special<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
names<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a>. Thus arises the division of the month into three
decades, in which however the last decade may vary between
9 and 10 days.</p>

<p>The division into decades is not so common as the halving
of the month. The Zuñi of Arizona divide the month
into three decades, each of which is called a ‘ten’<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a>. The
Ahanta of the western Gold Coast divide the moon-month into
three periods, two of ten days each, the third&mdash;which lasts
until the new moon appears&mdash;of about 9½ days (more correctly,
no doubt, varying between 9 and 10 days). The Sofalese
of East Africa must have done the same, since de Faria
says that they divided the month into 3 decades and that
the first day of the first decade was the feast of the new
moon<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>. The Masai, who number either the days of the whole
month consecutively or the days of its two halves, nevertheless
give special prominence to the initial days of the decades
(alongside of other notable days), and call them <i>negera</i><a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a>.</p>

<p>Among the Greeks the division into decades displaced
the older bisection. Of the names of the decades the first
and third refer to the concrete form of the moon: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μὴν ἱστάμενος</span>,
older <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀεξόμενος</span><a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a>, literally ‘the appearing, waxing moon’, and
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μὴν φθίνων</span>, ‘the waning moon’. For originally <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μήν</span> must here have
had the sense of ‘moon’ which the etymology suggests. The
second decade was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μὴν μεσῶν</span>, ‘the month at the middle’:
the epithet shews that <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μήν</span> here means ‘month’, and not
‘moon’. This name is therefore younger than the two others,
which must once have been used to describe the two halves
of the month, and do so still in Homer<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a>.</p>

<p>The custom of reckoning on the fingers or on a notched
stick has doubtless lent assistance to the counting of the days of
the month. The Wa-Sania make a notch in a stick for every
day, and when the month is ended they put this stick aside and
begin a new one<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a>. At the southern corner of Lake Nyassa
the days are counted by means of pieces of wood threaded
on a string<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a>. A complete enumeration of the days however<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
only exists among highly developed peoples who have discarded
a more concrete time-reckoning in favour of an abstract
system, just as the civilised peoples of modern Europe abandoned
the Roman system of time-reckoning, which was still
often used in the Middle Ages (though indeed it had long
since departed from its concrete basis), in favour of a simple
enumeration of the days of the month.</p>

<p>Finally a couple of curious East African reckonings of
the days of the month are to be mentioned, although they are
not primitive but have a lengthy development behind them.
A common feature of both is that the day of the new moon
is already the fourth day, so that the counting of the days
begins with the moon’s invisibility, which can hardly have
been the original practice. The Wadschagga divide the month
into four parts the days of which are numbered, the first and
third parts consisting of ten days each, and the second and
fourth of five days each. Accordingly they begin to count the
new moon at ‘the fourth day, which brings the moon’, the day
on which the slender delicate crescent of the moon first
reappears after sunset: for the rites of this day see <a href="#Page_153">above,
p. 153</a>. On the fourth day of the second division (the eleventh
after new moon) they say that ‘the moon turns to the
back of the house’: when twilight falls it is already seen
beyond the culmination-point. The fourth day of the third
division (the 16th after new moon) is called ‘the day that
brings the moon up from below’ (i. e. from the eastern horizon),
where ‘it appears like a pot’; the fourth day of the last
division is called ‘the four, which dismisses the moon’, and the
first of the first division, when the moon vanishes, ‘the one,
which floats away the moon so that it is no longer visible’:
it ‘tramples into pieces the days of the God’<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a>. The natural
phases of the moon therefore make themselves felt in spite of
the counting. With this, as is so often the case, is connected
a fully developed superstition concerning the days of the
month. The Masai in ordinary life reckon their moon-months
as consisting of 30 days, and number the days from 1 to 30 or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
29. Besides this there is a second way of counting which
begins at the 16th and reckons the days of darkness (<i>en aimen</i>).
Further, special prominence is given to certain days and groups
of days, e. g. to the 4th, the new-moon day, hence called also
<i>ertaduage duo olaba</i>, ‘the moon is to be seen’, to the 15th, <i>ol
gadet</i>, i. e. the rising moon ‘looks over’ to the sun which has
not yet set, and to the concluding day, the <i>eng ebor olaba</i>,
‘the brightness of the moon’, but especially to the days of the
dark half of the month, <i>en aimen</i>. The 16th is called <i>ol onjori</i>,
‘the greenish day’, the 17th, <i>ol onjugi</i>, ‘the red’, 18 to 20,
<i>es sobiaïn</i>, 21 to 23, <i>nigeïn</i>, 27 etc., <i>en aimen nerok</i>, ‘the black
darkness’. The people also emphasise the concluding days
of the decades<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a>. The natural foundation afforded by the phases
of the moon therefore appears very clearly: the only noteworthy
feature is that the days of the moon’s invisibility are
included in the division which is called ‘the brightness of the
moon’. An outside influence must no doubt be assumed.
Among the Masai also the selection of lucky and unlucky days
is common.</p>

<p>The starting-points in the counting of the days of
the month also afford evidence for the question as to
which phases of the moon are the oldest, and were already
utilised for this purpose. Both the methods of counting and
the phases themselves are based upon a bisection or trisection
of the month: to this were then added other phases,
originally quite unsystematically. Among us the quarters of
the moon are common; but of their use among primitive peoples
I have found only a single instance. Of the Papuans of
the Indian Archipelago it is stated that they divide the month
into four parts according to the phases of the moon: <i>paik
baleo</i>, the new moon, <i>paik jouwar</i>, the first quarter, <i>paik plejif</i>,
the waning of the moon, and <i>paik imar</i>, the old moon<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>. It
must not, of course, be taken for granted that these phases
are of equal length, as ours are.</p>

<p>That the quadripartite division of the month should be practically
non-existent among primitive peoples is easily to be understood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
in view of the considerations already mentioned. Unlike
the halving it is not based upon any very clearly distinguishable
phases, nor is there in the phases any such suggestion
of a quadripartite division as is offered for a tripartite.
The shape of the moon on the 8th or the 22nd day differs very
little from that of the previous and the following days, and
does not constitute a turning-point like the full moon. From
the phases of the moon no quadripartite division can arise: the
brightest phase of all, the full moon, has an unnatural position
in such a division. It can only be understood as a halving of
the halves of the month, and this presupposes that the moon’s
variation in light is regarded as a unity and divided into parts.
The primitive peoples however start not with the abstract
unity but with the concrete phases, proceeding at first quite
unsystematically, and only subsequently combining them into a
system. The quadripartite division therefore is in its very nature
a numerical system. That it has penetrated so profoundly
into our natures that even ethnological scholars and travellers
are not always able to get away from it, is due to the connexion
with the seven-day week, which is regarded as a division
of the month, and also to the fact that we so seldom
take any notice of the concrete phenomena of the heavens.</p>

<p>The quadripartite division must therefore be described as
not original (the case is different when the time of the moon’s
invisibility is added as a fourth phase to the three already
mentioned). To the best of my knowledge it appears first in
Babylonia<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a>, and gains ground together with the <i>sabattu</i>, i. e.
the appointing of every seventh day of the month as tabooed:
it has become common among us on account of the seven-day
week, which was conceived as a division of the month. In
reality the tripartite division is also the natural one, since it
arises from the concrete phenomenon of the moon, and not
from any division of the month into parts consisting of a certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
number of days. Here the full moon takes its proper
place, which it misses in the quadripartite division. The limitation
of the divisions to a definite number of days is secondary
throughout.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE MONTHS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy1">The (moon-)month has originally nothing to do with the
year and the seasons: this must be clearly and definitely
recognised. The months may be reckoned independently of the
year; nothing hinders us from counting up to twenty or a
hundred months. But most peoples, before they have developed
a definite system of time-reckoning, can count no farther than
ten at most, and in the time-reckoning the counting is of course
always the latest and most abstract stage. Such an enumeration
of the months may commence at any point of the year
and be continued <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad libitum</i>; in relation to the year it is not
fixed but shifting. Both series, the years and the months, are
enumerated without reference to one another, as our days of
the week in relation to the year, the days of the week falling
on different dates in different years.</p>

<p>The month however is a shorter period easy to survey, and
such divisions are necessary in order to split up the too long
period of the year. In itself the month has nothing to do with
the year, nor does it exactly fit into the year (12 × 29½,
about 355 days). It is impossible to combine the months with
the year without doing violence to the one or the other. The
time-reckoning of the modern civilised peoples has chosen this
latter expedient. The month has become a conventional sub-division
of the year; it is quite independent of the moon, and
keeps as reminders of its origin only its name and a length
approximating to that of the moon’s revolution. This has come
about because the moon, unlike the sun and the seasons depending
thereon, has no immediate influence upon the events
and occupations of our lives. We have therefore come back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
from the reckoning in moons to the purely solar year. It was
quite otherwise with the primitive peoples, whose time-reckoning
was so concrete. For them the moon afforded the only fixed measure
of the duration of time: its appearance impressed itself firmly
upon the mind. These peoples therefore, even at an advanced
stage of development, have tried to adjust the year by the
moon, which could only be done by adopting years of varying
length, of 12 and 13 months respectively. How this lunisolar
reckoning has arisen, it will be the object of the following
chapters to investigate. I begin by setting forth the somewhat
copious material for series of months.</p>

<p>For the peoples of North Asia I have hitherto been able
to make hardly any statements: the works are for the most
part written in Russian, and are for that reason inaccessible
to me. For the names of months, however, abundant material
is accessible.</p>

<p>The names given to the months by the Voguls, with variants
from the districts of Tawda, Konda, and middle and lower
Loswa (tributary of the Irtysh), are, beginning from Sept./Oct.:&mdash;1,
little autumn-hunting month, little autumn, autumn month;
2, great autumn-hunting month, month of the naked trees,
snow month; 3, winter month; 4, month of light (lengthening
of the days), winter month; 5, ski month, the little winter
month, wind month; 6, month of the thawing snow-crust; 7,
month of thaw, spawning month or month of corn-sowing; 8,
sap-in-firs month, ploughing month; 9, sap-in-birches month; 10,
middle-of-summer month; 11, month of the young razor-bills,
month of young water-fowl; 12, elk-running month. According
to Ahlqvist the midsummer month is distinguished as greater
or smaller. There must therefore, as is so often the case, be
13 months. Three months, nos. 7, 9, and 11, seem to have
no special names in the Tawda district, but this is not very
surprising<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>.</p>

<p>Schiefner in particular has collected extremely full and
detailed lists of the names of the months among the various
races of Siberia. These lists I here reproduce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<p>The Tchuvashes have the following thirteen months:&mdash;1,
thank-offering month, beginning in the middle of November;
2, very steep month; 3, month of little steepness; 4, spring
month; 5, free month; 6, sowing month; 7, summer month; 8,
the maidens’ month; 9, hay month; 10, sickle month; 11, flax
month; 12, threshing-floor month; 13, grave-post month. The
maidens’ month, which is said to owe its name to the custom
of celebrating marriages at that time, is also called ‘fallow-land
month’; the ‘free’ month is so called because in it no work is
done in the fields; the ‘grave-post’ month takes its name from
the feast of the dead, which is then celebrated on the graves,
with gifts of every kind.</p>

<p>The Ugric Ostiaks have 13 months:&mdash;1, spawning month,
about April; 2, pine sap-wood month; 3, birch sap-wood month;
4, salmon-weir month; 5, month of hay-harvest; 6, ducks-and-geese-go-away
month; 7, naked tree month (falling of the
leaves); 8, pedestrian month, since men go home on foot while
the ice still remains; 9, month in which men go on horseback;
10, great, 11, little winter-ridge month; 12, wind month; 13,
month of crows. Another list gives the following months:&mdash;1,
month in which the Obi dies (?), i. e. freezes; 2, month in
which tribute is imposed; 3, month of the little snow-crust, or
first spring month; 4, month of the great snow-crust; 5, month
of the unstable ice; 6, month when the syrok (a kind of salmon)
comes; 7, middle-of-summer month; 8, cloudberry month; 9,
month in which the track (the road) of the Obi freezes, or
first autumn month; 10, month in which the Obi freezes; 11,
month of the short days or of the deceptive feet or of the
dog’s feet; 12, month in which the tribute is levied&mdash;only
twelve months, therefore, but the list shews many variants and
does not seem to be in its right order, compare e. g. months
1 and 10, referring to the same natural phenomenon, which
in the nature of things is impossible.</p>

<p>The Yeneseisk Ostiaks:&mdash;1, summer month, about May;
2, not translated; 3, month when the ducks moult; 4, month
when the garrot moults; 5, month in which the <i>njelma</i> is
caught with great nets; 6, month in which the willow loses
its foliage; 7, winter month; 8, month in which the earth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
freezes; 9, reindeer-rutting month; 10, little month; 11, great
month; 12, eagle month; 13, squirrel month, in which the striped
squirrel comes out of its nest. The Yeneseisk Ostiaks of the
Sym are said to count only seven winter months, not the
summer months. They are:&mdash;1, month in which the earth
freezes; 2, reindeer-rutting month; 3, the little, 4, the great
month; 5, eagle month; 6, squirrel month; 7, spawning
month, in which the pike spawns. Another list gives:&mdash;1,
fall-of-the-leaf month; 2, month in which the earth begins to
freeze; 3, dog month, in which the dogs pair; 4, the little, 5,
the great month; 6, eagle month; 7, squirrel month; 8, spawning
month; 9, month in which the Ostiaks set traps to catch
sturgeon; 10, summer month, when the grass becomes green;
11, middle-of-summer month; 12, month in which the grass
turns yellow, or month of the white grass-tips; 13, autumn
month.</p>

<p>The Tatars of the Minusinsk district of the Yeneseisk government:&mdash;1,
the mild, easy month, or forest-month, since
the people go hunting, about September; 2, little cold; 3, great
cold; 4, the mottled month, bald patches of earth appear among
the snow; 5, severe cold; 6, high, when the sun moves high
above the horizon; 7, when the birds fly out in spring; 8, they
(i. e. the days) increase; 9, the red month; 10, (perhaps) little
drought; 11, birch-bark month, when birch-bark is collected;
12, grass month; 13, harvest month. There are also some
variants which are not translated.</p>

<p>The Karagasses, who live next to the Minusinsk Tatars:&mdash;1,
1/5&ndash;4/6, month of the low grass; 2, 4/6&ndash;2/7, birch-bark
month, in which birch-bark is collected, this being used for the
summer houses; 3, 2/7&ndash;30/7, month in which the lily-bulb is
red, i. e. blossoms; 4, 30/7&ndash;27/8, month in which the lily-bulb
is dug up; 5, 27/8&ndash;24/9, hammer month, when the cedar is
tapped with the hammer in order to shake down the ripe
cones with the nuts; 6, 24/9&ndash;22/10, reindeer-buck rutting
month; 7, 22/10&ndash;19/11, sable month, when people begin to
trap sables; 8, 19/11&ndash;17/12, month of the long rest, such as
is taken during the short days; 9, 17/12&ndash;15/1, month of frost;
10, 15/1&ndash;12/2, great frost-month; 11, 12/2&ndash;12/3, snow-shoe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
month, when over the deep but rotting snow deer and elks
are hunted in snow-shoes; 12, 12/3&ndash;9/4, month when the snow
becomes sticky; 13, 3/4&ndash;7/5, month in which people hunt with
dogs; this is the time when, owing to the night-frosts, a crust
forms on the snow, which is not strong enough to bear deer
and elks. The dates given by the author can at most be
applied only to one definite year.</p>

<p>The Buriats, from the new year:&mdash;1, month in which
the brooks freeze; 2, when the winter stores are seen to; 3,
roe moon; 4, deer moon; 5, sheep moon; 6, when the ice
breaks; 7, spring moon; 8, grass moon; 9, bulb moon; 10, milk
moon; 11, milch moon; 12, when after-math comes; 13, when
it ripens; the first month is also called the white month. The
Nishne-Udinsk Buriats:&mdash;1, roe month, since in this month
horns grow on the roe; 2, deer month, when the deer is
caught; 3, ram month, when the sheep pair; 4, month of the
red ridge of land, when the snow melts and the mountains
become red; 5, fish-spawning month; 6, leek month; 7, the
wild month, so called on account of the fierce heat; 8, roe
month, when the roes pair; 9, deer month, when the deer pair;
10, squirrel month, since this animal is then caught; 11, the
little sable month, sables are caught; 12, nest month, since the
animals, on account of the cold, creep into their dens and
nests. Only twelve months, therefore, as also among the
Tunkinsk Buriats, for whom are translated only:&mdash;1, the
white month; 2, the red mountain-ridge; 5, the wild month;
11, roe month; 12, deer month.</p>

<p>The year of the Tunguses is divided into summer and
winter. The names of the months are:&mdash;Summer: 1, <i>ilaga</i>
(fly, gnat), in this the leaves and the early blossoms come out;
2, <i>ilkun</i>, is the proper flowering moon; 3, <i>irin</i> (from <i>irim</i>, to
ripen), the wild fruit grows ripe; 4, <i>serula sanni</i> (perhaps
<i>sonnaja</i>, cervical vertebra), in this month the red deer pair;
5, <i>hukterbi</i>, brings the red deer new hair. Winter: 1, <i>okti</i>
(perhaps <i>okto</i>, road), when the first snow falls: immediately
after that the minever is good; 2, <i>mira</i> (shoulder-joint), has the
shortest days; 3, <i>giraun</i> (suggests <i>giramda</i>, bone), has days of
noticeably increasing length; 4, <i>okton kira</i> (time of the road),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
when the sables are covered; 5, <i>tura</i> (perhaps <i>turaki</i>, jackdaw),
when the cormorants come; 6, <i>schonka</i>, when the ice
becomes porous; 7, the beginning of the <i>tukun</i>, in which the
rivers become clear: the last part of this period belongs to
the summer year. Our informant, Georgi, speaks of thirteen
months, but only gives the above twelve names. Schiefner
conjectures that he has counted <i>tukun</i> twice, or else has run
two months together. For the Tunguses of the Sea of Okhotsk
only twelve months are enumerated, and of these are translated:&mdash;1,
grass month; 3, fish-and-horse month; 4, ripening
month (?); 5, wrist; 6, elbow; 7, shoulder-joint; 8, atlas; nos. 5
to 11 are named from the joints of the human frame, 5&ndash;8
following out a suggestion of an ascending, 9&ndash;11 that of a
descending order; the name of the twelfth month perhaps
means the back. This is only one method of reckoning: a hint
of it is already found in the preceding list. For the Tunguses
of the lower Amur twelve months are reported, of which nos.
7&ndash;10 are simply numbered and the other names are not explained.</p>

<p>Another traveller could only discover eleven months
among the Tunguses of the Amur, possibly only because of the
defective memory of his informants. But a year of eleven
months is said to exist among the Samoyedes of Yurak. The
months are:&mdash;1, month of leaf-fall, about August; 2, reindeer-rutting
month; 3, the dark month; 4, sand month, when the
winds drive the snow along like sand; 5, the calm month, no
storms; 6, the good month, the weather is favourable for trapping
animals; 7, eagle month; 8, geese month or month of
calves; 9, month of inundations; 10, spring month, literally
<i>wuenui-jiry</i>, <i>wuenui</i> is said of fish when they come up-stream
in great shoals; 11, the great month, since the days (or the
month) are very long.</p>

<p>The Ostiak Samoyedes have 12 months:&mdash;1, leaf-fall month,
about August; 2, month with the long days, or month when
the earth freezes; 3, month of the short days; 4, tax month,
month when the tax (i. e. the deer) is caught, or thumb month,
since the women, on account of the shortness of the days,
can make only the thumb of a glove; 5, mid-winter month;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
6, month of crows, the crows come; 7, eagle month; 8, month
in which the summer animals arrive; 9, month in which the fish
spawn; 10, month in which there is water in the little brooks;
11, month in which fish are dried; 12, <i>njelma</i>-month. Another
list of Samoyede months from the Bolshemelsk tundra runs, beginning
at our New Year:&mdash;1, middle month, or the cold breaks
an axe, must doubtless be ‘axe-handle month’, the axe-handle
splits with the cold; 2, month of return, when the sun has
turned back to summer, or hornless month; 3, eagle month; 4,
fish month, when people begin to fish in the lakes; 5, month
of calves, in which the reindeer-does calve; 6, geese month, the
geese begin to moult during the latter days of this month; 7,
fledged month, the geese after moulting are again in a condition
to use their wings; 8, maliz month, when the skins obtained
from the reindeer are turned into malizes (an undergarment), or the
reindeer rub the velvet off their horns; 9, reindeer-rutting month,
or sea-fish month, from the catching of the <i>omulj</i>; 10, hunting
month; 11, the first dark month, in which in the far north the
sun does not rise; 12, the great month of darkness.</p>

<p>Further, the Yakuts have only twelve months:&mdash;1, spawning
month; 2, month of pines, the people collect pine-bark
which is afterwards dried and ground into meal; 3, grass month;
4, hay-fork month, or the fourth month; 5&ndash;10 numbered; 11,
the month in which the foals are shut up in the day-time and
are kept from the mares, so that the latter can be milked;
12, month in which the ice floats away.</p>

<p>So also the Itälmen of Kamchatka:&mdash;Summer year,
beginning in May: 1, wood-cock month, from the arrival of the
wood-cock; 2, cuckoo month; 3, summer month; 4, moonlight
month, since people begin to fish in the moonlight; 5, leaves
and plants begin to wither and fall away; 6, titmouse month,
the porus-titmouse appears. The winter year begins with:&mdash;7,
nettle month, the nettles are gathered and hung up to dry;
8, ‘I am rather cold’; 9, ‘touch me not’: it is considered a
crime to drink in this month from springs and brooks with the
mouth or with hollow sticks: it must be done with great wooden
spoons or with shells; 10, ladder month, the ladder leading
to the balagans becomes very brittle owing to the cold; 11,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
vent-hole month, since the snow around the vent-hole thaws
and the earth again appears; 12, water-wagtail month, when
these birds arrive. Two other lists for Kamchatka contain
only ten months. Near the Kamchatka River the names are:&mdash;1,
sin-purifying month; 2, axe-handles break owing to the frost;
3, beginning of the heat (<em>sic!</em>); 4, the day becomes long; 5,
month of the snow-crust; 6, redfish month; 7, whitefish month;
8, <i>kaiko</i>-fish month; 9, the great whitefish month; 10, month
of the falling leaves, said to last as long as three of our months.
Among the northern Kamchadales the names are:&mdash;1, month
of the freezing of the rivers; 2, hunting month; 3, sin-purifying
month; 4, axe-handles burst; 5, time of the long day;
6, birth-time of the sea-beavers; 7, birth-time of the seals;
8, birth-time of the tame reindeer; 9, birth-time of the wild reindeer;
10, beginning of the fishing. The winter year begins in
November, the summer year in May.</p>

<p>For the Gilyaks two lists are given, each with twelve
months. That for the Amur estuary has two or three variants
for some months. The following are translated:&mdash;1, month
in which a kind of salmon spawns (?), or harpoon month (?);
2, month in which another species of salmon is caught; 3,
little month; 4, great month, or month in which another kind
of salmon is caught; 5, moulting-month; 6, half-year month (?);
8, year month; 9, eagle month; 10, snow-shovel month. On
the island of Sachalin:&mdash;3, fish-and-squirrel month; 4, little
month; 5, great month; 10, eagle month; 11, snow-shovel month.</p>

<p>The Aino of the Kurile Islands:&mdash;1, long days; 2, the
snow melts; 3, coalmouse month; 4, sea-gull’s eggs month;
5, guillemot’s eggs month; 6, foddering month; 7, salmon-catching
month; 8, month when the birds grow fat, or bird-snaring
month; 9, the grass withers, or month when the grass
is withered; 10, month of the short days; 11, winter month;
12, the-snow-fills-up.</p>

<p>The Aleuts begin the year in March:&mdash;1, the foremost,
or the time when people gnaw belts; 2, the period when
people gnaw belts for the last time, or the time when one is
out there (outside the house); 3, month of flowers; 4, young-of-animals
month; 5, month when the young animals are fat; 6,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
the warm month; 7, month in which hair grows, when the
feathers and coats of animals grow thick; 8, hunting-month; 9,
the month after hunting-month; 10, sea-lion month, when these
animals are caught; 11, the great month, which is longer than
any of the others; 12, cormorant month, when this bird is
caught in nets.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the attention paid to these names has not
been extended to the word which means ‘month’. It would be
valuable to know if the same word means ‘moon’: if so, it
would be clearly proved that a moon-month is in question.
Except in the lists for the Minusinsk Tatars and the Tunguses
the names end with the same word, which is translated ‘month’,
and in one case (the Buriats) ‘moon’, but this is doubtless a
peculiarity due to the authority; however, isolated names are
interspersed which have not this concluding word, as appears
also from the above translations. The number of days indicated
in the list <a href="#Page_176">pp. 176 f</a>. suits only to moon-months. Upon the
whole we are authorised in concluding that we have to do
with genuine moon-months. This is expressly stated by American
travellers, to whom we owe further information about
the peoples of eastern Siberia.</p>

<p>The year of the Koryak, north of Kamchatka, is divided
into twelve lunar months (called ‘moons’). The first month
begins at the time of the winter solstice and corresponds
to our December. Some months have different
names in different places, but the names of the months most
commonly used are as follows:&mdash;1, cold-winds month or snow-storms month;
2, (growing-of-)the-reindeer’s-spinal-sinew month;
3, false-making-udder month or reindeer-udder month<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a>; 4, reindeer-does’-calving
month; 5, water-month; 6, first summer-month;
7, second summer-month; 8, reddening (of leaves) month; 9,
pairing-season-of-the-reindeer-bucks month or empty (bare)-twigs
month; 10, autumn’s month; 11, rutting-season-of-mountain-sheep
month; 12, itself-head month or month-of-the-head-itself<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a>.</p>

<p>The Yukaghir names for their lunar months are given in
translation:&mdash;1 (July), the middle-of-the-summer month; 2, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
small mosquito month, because the mosquitoes appear; 3, the
fish month, because fishing is then taking place for the winter
stock; 4, the wild-reindeer buck month, the rutting-time of the
wild reindeer; 5, the autumn month; 6, before-the-ridge month;
7, ridge month, i. e. the ridge of the spinal column&mdash;because
in reckoning this month is denoted by the atlas, the first cervical
vertebra&mdash;, or the great butterfly month; 8, the little butterfly
month; here are meant the larvae of two species of gadfly
which in summer lay their eggs, one in the skin of the reindeer,
and the other in its nostril: during the winter the eggs
develop into larvae; 9, name not translated; 10, the ancient
men <i>cille</i> month: <i>cille</i> means the icy surface formed during
the night on the snow, after having melted during the day:
this commences in April; 11, leaf-month; 12, the mosquito
month, because the mosquito makes its appearance then<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>.</p>

<p>The same system recurs in North America. The Eskimos
of the Behring Straits divide up the time according to
the moon: by the ‘moons’ all time is reckoned during the year,
and dates are set in advance for certain festivals and rites.
Thirteen moons are reckoned to the year, although our
authority could not always obtain complete series. The list
is arranged according to our months:&mdash;1, ‘to turn about’,
named from a game with a top; 2, time when the first seals
are born; 3, time of creeping on game (refers to the seal-hunting
on the ice); 4, time of cutting off, from the appearance
of sharp lines of colour on the ptarmigan’s body; 5, time for
going in kayaks; 6, time for fawn-hunting; 7, the time when
geese get new wing-feathers (moulting); 8, time for brooding
geese to moult; 9, time for velvet-shedding (from horns of
reindeer); 10, time for setting seal-nets; 11, time for bringing
in winter stores; 12, time of the drum, the month when the
winter festival begins. Very often several different names may
be used to designate the same moon, if it should chance to
be at a season when different occupations or notable occurrences
in nature are observed: our authority has used the
most common terms. For the lower Yukon delta, near Mission,
the following list is drawn up:&mdash;1, season for top-spinning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
and running round the <i>kashim</i>; 2, time of offal-eating
(scarcity of food), or the cold moon; 3, time of opening the
upper passage-ways into the houses (this falls too early and is
referred to an earlier, warmer time); 4, birds come; 5, geese
come; 6, time of eggs; 7, time of salmon; 8, time for red salmon;
9, time for young geese to fly; 10, time for shedding
velvet from reindeer-horns; 11, mush-ice forms; 12, time of
musk-rats; 13, time of the feast. A third list was obtained
just south of the Yukon delta:&mdash;1, named from the game of
the top; 2, the time of much moon, i. e. long nights; 3, the
time of taking hares in nets; 4, the time of opening summer
doors; 5, arrival of geese; 6, time of whitefish; 7, time of
braining salmon; 8, geese moult; 9, swans moult; 10, the flying
away (migration of the birds); 11, time of velvet-shedding; the
names of the twelfth, and doubtless also of the thirteenth,
month were not obtained<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>.</p>

<p>The Central Eskimos divide the year into 13 months, the
names of which vary very much according to the tribes and
the latitude of the place. One month, <i>siringilang</i>, ‘without
sun’&mdash;the name covers the whole period of the year in
which the sun does not rise&mdash;is of indeterminate length
(<i>sic!</i>), and thereby serves to equalise the length of the year.
The name <i>qaumartenga</i> denotes only the days which are
without sun but have twilight, the rest of this month is called
<i>sirinektenga</i>; other names of months are not given<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a>. The
Eskimos of Greenland begin to count the moons at the winter
solstice. After the third moon they remove from the winter
houses into their summer tents. In the fourth they know that
the little birds are again to be seen and that the ravens lay
eggs, in the fifth the <i>angmasset</i> and the seals are once more
to be seen with their young, at the end of this month the
eider-ducks begin to brood and the reindeer-does to calve.
From this time on, only those who live on latitude 59° can
reckon by the moon any longer: the others count by the phenomena
of natural life<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<p>The Konyag of the island of Kodiak off the southern
coast of Alaska count from August the following months:&mdash;1,
the Pleiades begin to rise; 2, Orion rises; 3, hoar-frost covers
the grass; 4, snow appears on the mountains; 5, the rivers
and lakes freeze; 6, the sixth month; 7, dried fish is cut
in pieces; 8, the ice breaks; 9, the ravens lay eggs; 10, the
birds (e. g. ducks etc.) which stay about the island in winter
lay eggs; 11, the seals pair; 12, the porpoises pair<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a>. For the
Thlinkit two lists are given, the first, from Sitka, beginning
with August:&mdash;1, takes its name because all birds then come
down from the mountains; 2, ‘small moon’ or ‘moon-child’, so
called because fish and berries then begin to fail; 3, ‘big moon’,
because the first snow then appears, and bears begin to get
fat; 4, month when people have to shovel snow away from their
doors; 5, month when every animal on land and in the water
begins to have hair in the mother’s womb; 6, ‘<ins class="corr" id="tn-184" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'goose moonth'">
goose month</ins>’,
because it is that in which the sun starts back and people
begin to look for geese; 7, ‘black-bear month’, the month when
black and brown bears begin to have cubs and throw them
out into the snow; 8, the month when ‘sea-flowers’ and all
other things under the sea begin to grow; 9, ‘real-flower month’,
when flowers, nettles, etc. begin to shew life; 10, ‘tenth month’,
when people know that everything is going to grow; 11,
‘eleventh month’, the month of salmon; 12, ‘month when everything
is born’; 13, ‘month when everything born commences
to fatten’. The second list, from Wrangel, begins with January:&mdash;1,
‘goose month’, perhaps so called because the geese
were then all at the south; 2, ‘black-bear month’, the month when
the black bear turns over on the other side in his den; 3, ‘silver-salmon
month’: the reason of the name is unknown, this is not
their proper month; 4, ‘month before everything hatches’; 5,
‘month when everything hatches’; 6, meaning unknown; 7,
‘month when the geese cannot fly’; 8, ‘month when all animals
prepare their dens’; 9, ‘moon child’ or ‘young moon’; 10, ‘big
moon’; 11, ‘moon when all creatures go into their dens’; 12,
‘ground-hog-mother’s moon’; the thirteenth month is missing<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a>.
The author’s report consists in part of extremely doubtful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
explanations of the natives, and the whole seems hardly to
be in order: here, as everywhere, the memory of the old
names of the months has begun to fade away. The type to
which the list belongs, however, is well known.</p>

<p>Among the Shuswap of British Columbia the months have
two classes of names. They are called ‘the first month’ etc.,
or have recognised names derived from some characteristic.
The names among the Fraser River division, and their special
characteristics, are as follows:&mdash;1, or ‘going-in time’. People
commence to enter their winter houses. The deer rut. 2, or
(name not translated). First real cold. 3, or (d:o). Sun turns.
4, or ‘spring (winds) month’. Frequent Chinook winds. The
snow begins to disappear. 5, or ‘(little) summer (month)’.
Snow disappears completely from the lower grounds. A few
spring roots are dug, and many people leave their winter
houses at the end of the month. 6, or (name not translated).
Snow disappears from the higher ground. The grass grows
fast. People dig roots. 7, or ‘midsummer (month)’. People
fish trout at the lakes. 8, or ‘getting-ripe month’. Service-berries
ripen. 9, or ‘autumn month’. Salmon arrive. 10, or
(name not translated). People fish salmon all month. 11, or
(d:o). People cache their fish and leave the rivers to hunt.
Balance of the year, ‘fall time’. People hunt and trap game
in the mountains<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a>.</p>

<p>The moons used by the Spences Bridge band of the
Thompson Indians in the same country, and their principal
characteristics, are:&mdash;1, the deer rut, and people hunt. 2,
‘going-in time’, so named because most people went into their
winter houses during this month. The weather begins to get
cold, and the people go into their winter houses. 3, bucks
shed their antlers, and does become lean. 4, ‘spring (winds)
time’, so named because Chinook winds generally blow in this
month, melting all the snow. The weather improves, and the
spring plants begin to sprout. The people come out of their
winter houses. 5, ‘coming-forth time’, so named because the
people come forth from their winter houses in this month,
although many came out in the fourth month. The grass grows.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
6, the people catch trout with dip-nets, and begin to go to
the lakes to trap fish. The trees put forth leaves, and the waters
increase. 7, the people dig roots. 8, ‘they are a little
ripe’. The deer drop their young, and service-berries begin to
ripen. 9, ‘middle time’, so named because of the summer solstice.
The sun returns, and all berries ripen. Some of the
people hunt. 10, ‘first of run’, first or ‘nose’ of ascending fish.
The sockeye or red salmon run. 11, the Next Moon, or ‘(poor)
fish’, ‘they reach the source’. The cohoes or silver salmon
come, and the salmon begin to get poor. They reach the
sources of the rivers. 12, the Rest of the Year, or ‘fall time’.
The people trap and hunt, and the bucks begin to run<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a>.</p>

<p>The Lower Thompsons also called the months by numerals
up to ten or sometimes eleven, the remainder of the year
being called the autumn. Their names are as follows:&mdash;1,
the rutting-time of deer. 2, ‘going-in’. People go into their
winter houses. 3, ‘the last going-in’. 4, ‘little coming-out’,
‘spring or warm wind’. Alternate cold and warm winds. Some
people camp out in lodges for a time. 5, ‘going-in-again’. Last
cold. People go into winter houses again for a short time. 6,
‘coming-out’. Winter houses left for good. People catch fish
in bag-nets. 7, people go on short hunts. 8, people pick berries.
9, people commence to fish salmon. 10, people fish and cure
salmon. 11, or ‘to boil food a little’, so named because people
prepared fish-oil. Autumn. People hunt large game and go
trapping. The moons are grouped in five seasons<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a>. The names
of the Lillooet Indians are similar, eleven moons and the
rest of the year, the fall<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a>.</p>

<p>From the Kwakiutl of Vancouver Island series have been
obtained for four different tribes, the first and second tribes
having identical names for the months 2&ndash;8 and 10. The author
states that the knowledge of the moons seems to be disappearing,
and that it was difficult to obtain quite satisfactory evidence:
consequently he does not claim that his arrangement
is perfectly accurate. As a matter of fact some confusion seems
to have crept into the series. The names of the months, corresponding
to our March onwards, are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Between the tenth and twelfth the author inserts the winter
solstice, and says that the solstice moons are called by a name
which probably means ‘split both ways’: he adds that the
readjustment is made in mid-winter<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a>.</p>

<p>Of the Siciatl of British Columbia it is said that they
divide the year into twelve parts corresponding approximately
to our months: in these divisions the moon seems to play a
very subordinate part. In fact they are to be described as
seasons, since to their names is prefixed the same word, <i>tem</i>,
as to the three main seasons, e. g. <i>tem tcim</i>, ‘cold time’, winter,
<i>tem kaikq</i>, eagle-time, 1, January, so called because, as it is
asserted, the eagle hatches its eggs at this time. Further:&mdash;2,
time when the big fish lay their eggs; 3, budding time;
4, time of the <i>lem</i>, an unidentified bird of passage which remains
about a month; 5, time of the diver, which in this month
builds its nest and lays eggs; 6, ‘salmon-berry’ time; 7, ‘red-cap’
time, a kind of raspberry; 8, sallalberry time; 9, time when
the fish stop running; 10, time when the leaves fade; 11, time
when the fish leave the streams; 12, time when the raven
lays his eggs<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a>. However these divisions are doubtless originally
moon-months, as is suggested by the number twelve.
Probably the native time-reckoning has fallen into decay and
been forgotten under European influence. This is everywhere
the case, especially in regard to the moon-month. The Stselis
of the same district begin the year in autumn at October,
and name the months as follows:&mdash;1, spring-salmon spawning
season; 2, dog-salmon spawning season; 3, dancing season;
4, season for putting paddles away&mdash;from which they
number from 5 to 10. The time between July and October
was denoted by a word which means the coming together or
meeting of the two ends of the year. The latter part of this
division was also known as the time of the dying salmon, since
the creeks were at this time full of dead and dying salmon<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a>.
This list of months is curious, but its peculiarities&mdash;the ceasing
of the counting at ten,&mdash;and even the naming of the first
four months&mdash;are to be found among the Romans<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a>. However<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
it bears so little resemblance to all the other lists known
to us from this district that it becomes doubtful whether it is
original or a product of decay.</p>

<p>The name Piskwaus or Piscous is given to a small tribe
that lives on the little river which falls into the Columbia about
40 miles below Fort Okanagon. Their months, obtained from
a chief, shew that their habits are much the same as those of
their neighbours, the Salish, for the names of many of the months
have reference to some of their most important usages. One
of the chiefs (viz. of the Piskwaus) made only twelve names,
while the other (of the Salish) reckoned thirteen. Both had
some difficulty in calling to mind all the names. In several
the Piskwau chief is one moon ahead of the other, which may
arise from a mistake or possibly from some slight difference of
seasons at the two places. The list begins at the time of the
winter solstice:&mdash;1, not translated; 2, ‘cold’; 3, a certain
herb; 4, ‘snow gone’; 5, a bitter root; 6, ‘going to root-ground’;
7, <i>camass</i>-root; 8, ‘hot’; 9, ‘gathering berries’; 10, ‘exhausted
salmon’; 11, ‘dry’; 12 (missing in the Piskwau list) ‘house-building’;
13, ‘snow’<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a>.</p>

<p>The naming of the months from seasons (in the sense of
chapter II) is wide-spread over the whole of North America; only
under the curious civilisation of Arizona and neighbouring districts
does the system present special features.</p>

<p>The Creek Indians began the year immediately after the
celebration of the <i>busk</i> or ripening of the new corn, in August.
The moons are:&mdash;1, big ripening; 2, little, and 3, big chestnut;
4, falling leaf; 5, big winter; 6, little winter, or big winter’s
young brother; 7, windy; 8, little, and 9, big spring; 10,
mulberry moon; 11, blackberry moon; 12, little ripening moon<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a>.
An early French author relates of certain tribes in Nouvelle
France (western Canada) that they divide the year into twelve
moons which are named from animals but correspond to our
months. January and February are the first and the second
moons in which the bear brings forth its young, March is the
moon of the carp, April that of the crane, May that of the maize,
June the moon in which the bustard moults, July the month<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
of the rutting of bears, August the rutting-time of bulls, September
the rutting-time of deer, October that of elks, November
the rutting-time of the roebuck, December the moon in
which the roe sheds its horns. The tribes who live by the
sea call September the moon in which the trout spawn, October
the moon of the whitefish, November that of the herring;
to the other moons they give the same names as the inhabitants
of the interior<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a>.</p>

<p>Another traveller at the end of the 18th century relates
of the Sioux and Chippewa that they divide the year into
twelve moon-months to which from time to time an extra
month, known as the lost month, is added. March is the first
month of the year, and begins as a rule at the new moon after
the spring equinox: it is called the moon of the worms, since
the worms then leave their holes under the bark of trees or
the other places where they have been hiding during the
winter, April is the moon of the plants, May, the moon of flowers,
June, the warm moon, July, the moon of the roe-buck, August,
the moon of the sturgeon, which are then caught in great
numbers, September is the moon of the maize, since it is then
reaped, October is the moon of journeys, since the people leave
the villages and depart to the district in which they intend to
hunt in the winter, November, beaver’s moon, since this animal
then goes back into its lodge after having collected winter
stores, December, hunting-moon, January, cold moon, February,
snow moon, because most snow falls in that month<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a>.</p>

<p>A fairly contemporary account of the tribes of Pennsylvania
runs:&mdash;The months have each a separate name, but
not the same name among all tribes, since the names refer
chiefly to the climate of the district, and the benefits and good
things enjoyed in it. Thus the Lenope, who lived by the Atlantic
Ocean, called March the month of shads, since the shad
then came up from the sea into the rivers to spawn; but since
in the district to which they afterwards migrated this fish is
not found, they changed the name of the month and called it
the juice-dripping or the sugar-refining month, since at this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
time the juice of the sugar-maple begins to flow. April is
called the spring month, May, the month of plants, June, ‘deer
half-month’, or the month in which the deer bring forth their
young, or also the month in which the hair of the deer is
reddish, July, the summer month, August, corn-ear month, since
the ears of corn (cobs of maize) can then be roasted and
eaten, September, autumn month, October, gathering or harvest
month, December, hunting month, which is the time when all
deer have shed their horns, January, mouse and squirrel month,
since these animals then come out of their holes, February,
month of frogs, since on warm days the frogs begin to make
themselves heard. The translator adds in a note:&mdash;November,
hunting month, December, month in which the stags shed
their horns<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a>. Some tribes give to January a name which signifies
‘the return of the sun to them’, probably because the
days once more become longer. The names are therefore
not the same for all tribes, and those of the Moonsey, a tribe
of the Delaware, do not even agree with one another<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a>.</p>

<p>The following is very instructive both for the influence
of the natural phenomena upon the terminology and for the
fluctuating character of the terminology itself:&mdash;The wild
rice is an important article of food for the tribes of the west
by the Great Lakes; three important branches of the Algonquin,
and also smaller tribes, name one or two months from
this plant. The Ojibwa call August or September the moon
of the gathering of wild rice, or the wild rice moon; the
Ottawa, Menomini, and Potawatomi have the wild-rice-gathering
moon, which among the last-named corresponds to the end of
September and the beginning of October; the Dakota call September
‘ripe rice moon’, October is the moon in which the wild
rice is gathered and laid up for the winter; according to Neill,
September is the moon when the rice is laid up to dry, October
the ‘drying-rice moon’; according to Long, September is ‘the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
beginning’, October ‘the end of wild rice’; according to Atwater
September is ‘the moon when the wild rice is ripe’<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a>.</p>

<p>A list of the Dakota months gives:&mdash;January, the hard
moon; February, the raccoon moon; March, the sore-eye moon;
April, the moon in which the geese lay eggs, or when the
streams are navigable,&mdash;among the Teton, moon when the ducks
come back; May, the planting moon; June, the moon when the
strawberries are red,&mdash;Teton, when the seed-pods of the Indian
turnip mature, or when the <i>wipazoha</i> (berries) are good;
July, the moon when the choke-cherries are ripe, or when the
geese shed their feathers,&mdash;Teton, the deer-rutting moon;
August, the harvest moon,&mdash;Teton, the moon when the plums
are red; September, the moon when rice is laid up to dry,&mdash;Teton,
moon in which the leaves become brown; October,
the drying-rice moon,&mdash;Teton, moon when the wind shakes
off the leaves, or corn-harvest moon; November, the deer-rutting
moon,&mdash;Teton, the winter moon; December, the moon
when the deer shed their horns,&mdash;Teton, the midwinter

<p>Some of the tribes of the Cheyenne name twelve moons
in the year, but many tribes have not more than six; and different
bands of the same tribe, if occupying widely separated
sections of the country, will have different names for the same
moon. Knowing well the habits of the animals, and having
roamed over vast areas, they readily recognise any special
moon that may be mentioned, even though their name for it
may be different. One of the nomenclatures used by the Teton-Sioux
and the Cheyenne, beginning with the moon just
before winter, is as follows:&mdash;1, moon when the leaves fall
off; 2, when the buffalo cow’s foetus is getting large; 3, when
the wolves run together; 4, when the skin of the foetus of the
buffalo commences to colour; 5, when the hair gets thick on
the buffalo foetus, called also ‘men’s month’, or ‘hard month’;
6, the sore-eye moon, buffalo cows drop their calves; 7, moon
when the ducks come; 8, moon when the grass commences
to get green and some roots are fit to be eaten; 9, moon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
when the corn is planted; 10, when the buffalo bulls are fat;
11, when the buffalo cows are in season; 12, when the plums
get red<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a>.</p>

<p>The Omaha name the moons as follows, from January
on:&mdash;1, when the snow drifts into the tents of the Honga;
2, the moon when geese come home (back); 3, the little frog
moon; 4, the moon in which nothing happens; 5, the moon in
which they plant; 6, the buffalo bulls hunt the cows; 7, when
the buffalo bellow; 8, when the elk bellow; 9, when the deer
paw the earth; 10, when the deer rut; 11, when the deer shed
their antlers; 12, when little black bears are born. The Oto
and Iowa tribes use the same names for the months, except
for January, which is called ‘the raccoon month’<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a>. The Kiowa
have twelve months, but some writers give 14 or 15, the
names of which are repetitions of the others. As to the first
eight all are unanimous, for the ninth all informants but one
are in agreement, for the following there is disagreement. The
list, which begins in Sept.-Oct., comes from an Indian specially
well versed in the calendar. 1, the ‘ten-colds moon’:
the first ten days are cold, after the full moon winter and the
new year begin; 2, ‘wait until I come’ (<i>äganti</i> without the word
<i>p’a</i>, ‘moon’); 3, ‘geese-going moon’, sometimes ‘sweathouse
moon’; 4, ‘real-goose moon’; 5, ‘little-bud moon’, the first buds
come out: the first half belongs to winter, the second to
spring; 6, ‘bud moon’, sometimes with ‘great’ prefixed; 7,
‘leaf moon’; 8, summer <i>äganti</i>: its full moon forms the boundary
between spring and summer; 9, ‘summer-geese-going moon’,
seems to be placed too late; 10, ‘summer-real-goose moon’; 11,
‘little-moon-of-deer-horns-dropping-off’, the deer begin to shed
their horns; 12, similarly named, or sometimes with the addition
of ‘great’: with this full moon autumn begins<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a>. The year
of the Pawnee varied between 12 and 13 months; the names
are not given<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a>, nor are those of the Klamath and Modok<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a>,
or of the Occaneechi of Virginia<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a>. The Bannock call the earlier
months:&mdash;1, running season for game; 2, big moon; 3, black<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
smoke (it is cold); 4, bare-spots-along-the-trail (the snow vanishes
in places); 5, little grass, or the grass first comes up;
for the months of the warm season they have no names<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a>. For
the Mandan there is a list with twelve months, which I have
been unable to obtain: the ‘seven-cold-days’ month, the pairing
month, and the ‘sore eye’ month are quoted<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a>.</p>

<p>The Seminole of Florida count 12 months, only the following
names are translated:&mdash;1, little winter; 2, wind moon;
3, big wind moon; 4, little, and 5, big mulberry moon; 12,
big winter. 7 and 8, 9 and 10 are also paired, the latter in
each case being described as ‘big’; 6 and 11 have single
names<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a>. The Chocktaw of Louisiana have forgotten their names,
only a few could be enumerated:&mdash;December, cold moon; February,
moon of snow; March, moon of wind; April, corn(-planting)
moon; July, moon of fire. The women asserted that the
year was divided into twelve moons, but our authority thinks
it highly probable that thirteen is the correct number<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a>. The
Natchez had 13 months, and celebrated at each new moon a
feast which took its name from the principal fruits gathered
or the animals hunted in the previous month. Their year began
in March. 1, moon of the deer; 2, moon of the strawberries,
which are then gathered; 3, moon of the little corn:
this was often awaited with impatience, their harvest of the
great corn never sufficing to nourish them from one harvest
to another; 4, moon of the water-melons; 5, moon of the peaches;
6, moon of the mulberries; 7, moon of the maize, or great
corn; 8, moon of the turkeys, which at that time come out
from the thick woods into the open woods; 9, moon of the
bison, which are then hunted; 10, moon of the bears; 11,
moon of the cold meal; 12, moon of the chestnuts, although
these have long since been collected; 13, moon of the nuts
(which is added to complete the year). The nuts are crushed
and mixed with flour to make bread<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a>.</p>

<p>The tribes of Arizona, among whom religion and ceremonial
rites have attained a pre-eminent place, occupy a special
position; their time-reckoning has developed into a ceremonial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
year. However the natural foundation peeps through. Among
the Hopi thirteen names with the addition <i>mü’iyawu</i>, ‘moon’,
are given, so that genuine moon-months must be implied. The
second part of <i>ücü</i>, October, is said to be called <i>tü’hoe</i>; if this
is recognised as a month, there are 14 of them. Several of
the priests say that there are 13 months, others 12, still others
14. It is to be noted that the seasons and the festivals are
determined by observation of the sun in relation to certain
terrestrial marks; of these sun-points there are 13. The names
of the months are not translated: several recur, but not in the
same order, 1 = 8, 2 = 10, 5 to 7 = 11 to 13. But it is stated
also that the months are divided into ‘named’ and ‘nameless’<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a>.
The Zuñi divide the year into two seasons, each consisting
of six months. The months are:&mdash;December, turning
or looking back (of the sun); January, limbs of trees broken
by snow; February, no snow in the road; March, little wind
month; April, big wind month; May, no name. The same names
are said to recur in the second half-year!<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> This can only be
an entirely conventional arrangement. But according to other
sources the six later months, though called ‘the nameless’,
have ritualistic names (Yellow, Blue, Red, White, Variegated,
Black) derived from the colours of the prayer-sticks offered up
at every full moon to the gods of the north, west, south, east,
zenith, and nadir, who are represented by these colours<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a>.
The Pima have 12 months. Two different lists from two natives
are given. (I):&mdash;1, saguaro harvest moon; 2, rainy; 3, short
planting; 4, dry grass; 5, winter begins; 6, yellow; 7, leaves
falling; 8, cottonwood flowers; 9, cottonwood leaves; 10, mesquite
leaves; 11, mesquite flower; 12, black seeds on saguaros.
(II):&mdash;1, wheat harvest moon; 2, saguaro harvest; 3, rainy;
4, short planting; 5, dry grass; 6, windy; 7, smell; 8, big winter;
9, gray; 10, green; 11, yellow; 12, strong<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a>. The names
of colours recur, but seem here to have reference to the seasons.
That the wheat culture has been newly introduced does
not by any means imply that the series of months is of recent
origin, but only points to the familiar instability of their names.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<p>For South America I find in the literature accessible
to me no names of months recorded, except for the Inca
people alone. Their series of months, which is collected from
various sources, runs (beginning about January):&mdash;1, small
growing moon; 2, great growing moon; 3, flower-growing moon;
4, twin-ears moon; 5, harvest moon; 6, breaking-soil moon; 7,
irrigation moon; 8, sowing moon; 9, moon of the Moon-feast;
10, moon of the Feast of the province of Uma; 11, moon of
the Feast of the province of Ayamarca; 12, moon of the Great
Feast of the Sun. The ceremonies in connexion with this last
festival were made to approximate to the moon’s phases, the
various stages commencing with the ninth day, full moon, and
the 21st day<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a>. Nowadays the ability to bring the lunar year
into agreement with the solar is usually denied to this people,
although older writers have claimed this knowledge for them<a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a>.
This is naturally correct, in so far as a leapyear cycle is
meant; but it seems to me unlikely that the Inca people
was unable to bring the moon-months into their proper position
in the year by an occasional intercalation of a thirteenth
month, when this became necessary. The not nearly so highly
civilised Indians of North America could do this, and the Incas
observed the solstices. The first eight names alone shew
that. Perhaps the other months, as among certain tribes of
N. American Indians, were originally nameless (it was no
doubt the time when there was no work in the fields); that the
names are of late origin is shewn by the reference to various
provinces of the kingdom. The tribes of Bolivia also have
moon-months<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a>, and among the Orinoco Indians months are
mentioned<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a>. The Karaya of Central Brazil know that the
year has 13 full moons<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a>.</p>

<p>In Africa the lists of months are not so numerous as in the
parts of the world hitherto mentioned. There are however
plenty of them, and that not among the peoples most deeply
influenced by civilisation: among such peoples the Islamite
months have gained admission. In Morocco, southern Algeria,
and even in the Sudan the Julian months are also found. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
examples of a reckoning in months which relates to the seasons
come from South and Central Africa, and therefore from
the districts which have been more free from foreign influence.</p>

<p>The Hottentot series of months has fallen into decay.
I reproduce the list of Schulze, who mentions another in Kroenlein,
<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wortschatz der Khoi-Khoin</cite> (Berlin, 1899), which has only
nine names. His February corresponds to Schulze’s January;
only in the position of the name for July, which Schulze claims
for October, do the two lists differ considerably. The list, the
positions of the months, and other statements come from an
old Hottentot woman. The author however could not be quite
sure that the ideas of the whites had not already influenced
the number of months and their succession. The month begins
when the crescent of the moon appears in the western sky. 1
(corresponds to about January), moon which follows upon the
<i>salsola</i>-bush, which is an important pasture-bush and has its
principal flowering-season in spring; 2, not translated; 3, when
it begins to be cold; 4, by older Hottentots explained as the
month of increasing cold: when one sits so near the fire that
the legs blister; 5, the black month, time of drought, the black
branches of the stripped bushes give the landscape this character;
6, not translated; 7, month of the Pleiades, which become
visible in the latter half of June, and are of importance
for the natives journeying in quest of <i>tsama</i>; 8, not translated;
9, the month when the leaves are curled up by the cold; 10
and 11, not translated; 12, named from the fact that when,
after the first productive rains upon the old and withered grass,
the fresh young green shoots up, the meadows appear to be
dappled<a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a>.</p>

<p>For the Basuto a native gives the following list:&mdash;1,
<i>phato</i> = August, begins the year; 2, <i>loetse</i>, from <i>loetsa</i>, ‘to
anoint wounds with fat, syringe the ear’, since the winter is
broken and a little warmth comes; 3, <i>mphalane</i>, <i>mphalane ’a
leshoma</i>, <i>leshoma</i> a kind of bulb which at that time begins to
sprout, perhaps from <i>liphalana</i>, to glitter, the sun glitters, does
not warm, or because of the girl-circumcision, which is announced
by means of the blowing of <i>liphalana</i>-flutes by the old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
women who perform the operation; 4, <i>pulungoana</i>, diminutive
of <i>pulumo</i>, gnu, which at this time brings forth its young; 5,
<i>tsitoe</i>, grasshopper, which is especially to be heard at this
time; 6, <i>pherekong</i>, perhaps ‘interjoin sticks’; 7, <i>tlhakola</i> =
<i>hlakola</i>, to wipe off, <i>tlhakola molula</i>, to wipe off the <i>molula</i>:
<i>molula</i> is the stage at which the <i>mabele</i> grain is still completely
enveloped in the husk: now the grains shoot forth and
the <i>molula</i> disappear, <i>molula</i> also means a kind of grass which
is used in basket-work; 8, <i>tlhakubele</i>, from <i>thlaku</i>, grains: therefore:&mdash;the
<i>mabele</i> plant has grains; 9, <i>’mesa</i>, <i>’mesa tseleng</i>, kindling
fire by the roadside, as is done by those who drive away
the birds from the fields, either to warm themselves or to roast
ears of corn; 10, <i>motseanong</i>, i. e. ‘bird-laugher’, since the
grains are by now so firmly fixed in the ears that the birds
cannot get them; 11, <i>phupjoane</i>, from <i>phupu</i>, ‘beginning to
swell’, with reference to a kind of bulb; 12, <i>phuphu</i>, ‘bulging
out’, i. e. bulbs and the stems of some hardy plants<a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a>.</p>

<p>Of the Caffres we are told:&mdash;They count in the year
only twelve months, and for these they have names: the result
is frequent confusion and difference of opinion as to which
month it really is. There is, for example, the month of the
cuckoo, when this bird is first heard, the month of the erythusia,
when this plant blossoms, the month of much dust, mid-winter.
The names of the moons are more or less descriptive
of the season, e. g. <i>newaba</i>, green, describes the first appearance
of the vegetation; <i>furnfu</i>, September, cattle licking
green grass; <i>zibandhlela</i>, October, footpaths being covered
with grass; <i>hlolange</i>, January, time to look for first-fruits;
<i>hlangula</i>, May, time of falling leaves<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a>. Unfortunately the complete
list is not given.</p>

<p>By the Baronga the months or moons are now almost
completely forgotten, at least among the southern clans. The
following statements come from the northern clans, where the
names have been better preserved:&mdash;<i>nhlangula</i>, the month in
which the flowers are swept from the trees, probably October,
in which various trees blossom; <i>nwendjamhala</i>, the month in
which the antelope <i>mhala</i> brings forth its young (November?);<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
<i>mawuwana</i>, when the <i>tihuhlu</i> are plucked, because the people
shout ‘<i>wuwana, wuwana</i>’ in their joy at having plenty of almonds
to suck (December); <i>hukuri</i> is said to be the month
when the fruits of the <i>nkwakwa</i> are ripe (December also?);
<i>ndjati</i> or <i>ndjata</i>, i. e. ‘I am coming’. It is the time of <i>nwebo</i>,
when everyone in his fields is eating the new cobs of mealies,
and if you call, a person will answer:&mdash;“I come directly!
Have patience! I am busy”. This may be January or February.
<i>Sunguti</i> is also one of the summer months; <i>sibamesoko</i>, the
moon which closes the paths, also called <i>dwebindlela</i> or <i>sibandlela</i>
(February), is the time when the grass grows so high
that it hides the paths; <i>nyenyana</i>, nywenywankulu are the
months of the birds (<i>nyenyana</i>), when one spends the time in
chasing them from the fields (March and April); <i>mudashini</i>,
i. e. ‘What am I to eat?’ is so named because in the harvest
month there are so many different kinds of food that you do
not know which to choose (May or June); <i>khotubushika</i>, i. e.
‘when winter comes’, is probably June or July<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a>.</p>

<p>For the Herero the following list is given:&mdash;1 (January),
month of rain; 2, lambing month; 3, first pools of water; 4,
last pools of water; 5, lily month; 6, month of good luck; 7,
rising of the water in the river beds; 8, month of fog; 9,
Pleiades month: the Pleiades become visible and then <i>okuni</i>,
spring, begins; 10, first month, and therefore the first month
in the Herero reckoning (<em>sic!</em> probably of the spring, cp. the
following); 11, last moon namely the last month, of spring; 12,
dry, hard moon<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a>. Another list has:&mdash;1 (January), Vley water;
2, birth-time of springboks; 3, last Vley water; 4, last rain-showers;
5, cold days; 6, dry period; 7, dry trees; lambing
season; 9, a lily begins to bud; 10, the milk-bushes become
green; 11, the rain begins; 12, wet period<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a>.</p>

<p>In Loango the names of the months differ considerably
according to the situation of the district and the influence of
this upon the habits of life:&mdash;Month of expectation, month of
the little rains, of drought, of the curse, of the great rains, of
the water, of men, of women, of the harvest, of the vanishing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
water, of fish, of the rice, of trade, of mist, of salt, of sleep,
of the huts, of the burning (of grass and brushwood), of mirth,
of labour, of aid, between-month, cold month, wood month, bud
month, besom-and-dirt month (great cleaning), and any other
terms in popular use<a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the tribesmen of Upper Wellé give to the months
names in keeping with what is done in them. Thus one month
is named as that in which they sow <i>maroo</i>, the chief ingredient
used in brewing native beer; another as the season when <i>maroo</i>
must be cut. Following this comes the ‘bad-water’ month, when
the risk of fever is greatest; then the elephant month, when
they catch elephants by burning grass, and the white-ant month,
during which white ants are collected, and considered a great
delicacy; and a second <i>maroo</i> month, when a second crop is
sown. The month next to this has no distinctive name, and
is succeeded by the second <i>maroo</i>-harvest month, the hungry
or water-month, when provisions are scarce; the second ant-gathering
month; a late sowing month, and finally another
with no particular title. Altogether 13, therefore<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a>. For the
Shilluk twelve months are enumerated without translation:
‘moon’ and ‘month’ are expressed by the same word<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a>. The
Akamba of British East Africa assert that they reckon eleven
months to the year, <i>anzwa</i>:&mdash;1, <i>mwa</i>, planting month; 2, <i>wima</i>,
time of the autumn rains; 3, <i>wiu</i>, month of sprouting; 4, <i>mveu</i>,
5, <i>onkonono</i>, both untranslated; 6, <i>thandatu</i>, commence reaping;
7, <i>moanza</i>, not translated; 8, <i>nyanya</i>, ‘friend’ (sic!); 9, <i>kenda</i>,
‘nine’; 10, <i>ekumi</i>, ‘ten’ (in 1907 this month began on August
10); 11, <i>mubiu</i>, season of grass-burning. They say that the
month has 31 days and that they see the new moon on the
32nd; they assert that they do not include the first day on
which the moon is seen<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a>. The system has evidently already
fallen into decay, so that too great importance must not be
attached to its peculiarities. The Wa-Sania of British East
Africa divide their twelve months into three periods of four:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
the names are not given<a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a>. The Wagogo months are:&mdash;1,
<i>mosi</i>, ‘the first’, about December; 2, <i>mhiri</i>, ‘general’ (i. e. rains
everywhere); 3, <i>mhalungulu</i>, ‘cessation’ (sc. first rains over);
4, <i>munye</i>, ‘possessing’, i. e. enjoying first-fruits; 5, <i>mwezi we
litika</i>, month of plenty; 6, <i>mwezi we lisololela</i>, month of beginning
reaping; 7, <i>mwezi we nhwanga</i>, threshing-month; 8,
<i>mwezi we taga matoto</i>, month when the harvest is ended; 9,
<i>mwezi we tutula</i>, month of forest-clearing; 10, <i>mwezi we ndawa
mbereje</i>, month of digging up the stubbles; 11, <i>murisimuka</i>,
budding; 12, <i>muchilanhungo</i>, ‘partial’ (sc. partial rains, not
general)<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a>. The Nandi begin with the last month of drought,
about February:&mdash;1, <i>kiptamo</i>, ‘hot in the fields’; 2, <i>iwat-kut</i>,
rain in showers; 3, <i>wake</i>, meaning unknown; 4, <i>ngei</i>, the heart
pushed on one side by hunger; 5, <i>rob-tui</i>, black rain or black
clouds; 6, <i>puret</i>, mist; 7, <i>epeso</i>, meaning unknown; 8, <i>kipsunde</i>,
offering to God in the corn-fields; 9, <i>kipsunde oieng</i>, second
offering to God; 10, <i>mulkul</i>, strong wind; 11, <i>mulkulik oieng</i>,
second strong wind; 12, <i>ngotioto</i>, the <i>Brunsvigia Kirkii</i> or pin-cushion
plant<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a>.</p>

<p>The Masai divide their twelve months into four seasons,
(I), <i>ol dumeril</i>, time of the scanty rain-fall:&mdash;1, <i>ol gissan</i>, in
which the sheep and goats bring forth their young; 2, <i>ol adallo</i>,
the heat of the sun; 3, <i>ol golua</i> (<i>loo-’n-gushu</i>). (II), <i>en gokwa</i>,
the Pleiades (<i>l’apaïtin te-’l-lengon</i>, the months of superfluity):&mdash;4,
<i>le erat</i> (<i>kuj-orok</i>), formed from <i>er rata</i>, ‘green valley’; the
hitherto scanty rain has been sufficient to cover with fresh
green the valleys and low-lying spots of the otherwise still
yellow withered steppes; 5, <i>os somisso</i> (<i>oäni-oingok</i>), ‘the dark’,
‘gloomy’: the sky is overcast, there is much rain, the days are
dark and gloomy; 6, <i>ol nernerua</i> (<i>loo-’n-gokwa</i>), formed from
<i>nerneri</i>, ‘fat’. (III), <i>ol airodjerod</i>, the lesser after-rains:&mdash;7,
<i>le logunja airodjerod</i> (<i>kara-obo</i>), also called <i>oieni oinok</i>, ‘the
tied-up bulls’: owing to the abundant fodder of the last months
the bulls have become wild, and would be continually fighting
each other in the meadows, for which reason they are separated;
8, <i>bolos airodjerod</i> (<i>kiperu</i>), or also (but more rarely)
<i>ol dat</i>; 9, <i>kudjorok</i> (<i>l’iarat</i>), ‘cold’, cold weather distinguishes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
this month. (IV), <i>ol aimeii</i>, time of hunger, of drought:&mdash;10,
<i>kiber</i> (<i>pushuke</i>), uproar, quarrel. The pasture is thin, the
milk scanty, and people try to steal from other persons’ cows:
at last the milk is not sufficient to satisfy the necessary demands
of hunger, and most of the warriors go off into the forest with
some of the oxen to eat flesh. This lasts not only throughout
this month but also during the next. 11, <i>ol dongosh</i>, ‘stretched’,
since in this month too the milk is very scarce. The name seems
to be derived from the word <i>en gushush</i>, ‘lack of food’. Only at
the beginning of the 12th month, the <i>boshogge</i> (<i>ol-oiborare</i>),
do the people come back to the kraal. I have followed Merker,
p. 156. Hollis, pp. 333 ff., gives in some cases other names,
which unfortunately are not translated; they are here given in
brackets. Nos. 4 and 9 have exchanged names. It is worthy
of note that the month of the evening setting of the Pleiades
(<i>gokwa</i>) is named from this constellation. A further variation
is that according to Hollis the first month is <i>kara-obo</i>. The
year therefore begins with the season of the after-rains.</p>

<p>The Wadschagga of Kilimanjaro have likewise twelve
months; ten are denoted by numerals; the counting begins at
the fifth, and the months are divided into seasons. Nos. 5&ndash;8
fall in the season of the great rains, 9 and 10 in the dancing
season. In the ninth the people say: ‘It is bright’; the rainy
season passes away, and for this reason this month is regarded
as the beginning of the year, sacrifices are offered up at the
gates of the country, the chief ‘raises the field-stick’, i. e. gives
permission for the beginning of the ploughing, after having
previously ‘let the year open’ by offering a special sacrifice
to the spirits for good fruit and harvest. The name of the
following month, <i>iyana</i>, now means ‘a hundred’, but formerly
it probably had the sense of ‘ten’. This, the 10th, month is
followed by the first; the 1st and the 2nd months fall in the first
warm season, the 3rd in the little rainy season. The three
months of the great heat are not denoted by numerals. They
are interpolated between the 3rd and the 5th months. The first
of these is called <i>nsaa</i>: a month known as the fourth is then
said to be missing, but our authority conjectures that <i>nsaa</i> is
perhaps a mutilated form of an old word for four; the month<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
that follows <i>nsaa</i> is called <i>muru</i>, which is left unexplained,
and the next is <i>nsangwe</i> or <i>nsango</i>. Then the 5th month
comes again. The name <i>nsangwe</i> is almost everywhere explained
by the people as arising from <i>nsana-ngwi</i>, ‘to collect wood for
burning’. The supplies of wood for the rainy season are collected.
The position of this month immediately before the
rainy season misleads them into thus explaining the similar
sound. These last two months are clearly to be recognised
as interpolations in the original scheme of ten months. But
there still exists a name for a thirteenth month, which is of
course necessary for the correcting of the lunar year, and
which, as the old folks say, was formerly actually counted.
But now they say:&mdash;“It is a sham month, since it has no
companions, no comrades, and therefore it is superfluous. The
year has only twelve months.” It is called <i>nkinyambwo</i>. The
people say:&mdash;“The <i>nkinyambwo</i> is no longer necessary, since
the rainy season has now only three months, not four as in
olden times.” The practice of beginning an enumeration of the
months with the 5th month <i>kusanu</i> arouses the suspicion that
this may be the actual beginning of the year. To this the
other names of this month also point: ‘on the boundary of the
year’, or <i>maraya a kisie</i>, which can now only be translated
as ‘the ender of the rain’. But as a matter of fact this
month ushers in the rainy season. It has therefore been
pushed from its former position in the course of the year after
the rainy season to a position before the beginning of the
period of greatest rains, and the practice of beginning the
enumeration with <i>kusanu</i> is now the sole reminder of a time
when <i>kusanu</i> really did introduce the new year at the beginning
of the chief ploughing-season. But the first month <i>nsi</i> must
once have been one of the starting-points of the counting<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a>.
That the two months above-mentioned are interpolations does
not seem to be correct: for the <i>nkinyambwo</i> shews that the
Wadschagga, like so many other peoples, have had thirteen
months, one of which was omitted when necessary. The process
seems clear from the statements given. When the thirteenth
month (probably under Islamite influence) passed out of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
use, in the now strictly lunar year the months got out of place
in reference to the seasons. If the fifth month <i>kusanu</i> keeps
the place in reference to the seasons to which its other names
point, it falls in the ninth month of the author’s list, <i>kukendu</i>,
which, according to natural conditions, is the beginning of the
year. That only ten months are numbered and the others
named affords independent evidence, and is in keeping with the
system of counting in tens. That the two months in question
are inserted between the third (or fourth) and the first points
to a conventionalising of the system such as is anything but
primitive. Here, as always, numbered months shew themselves
to be a late phenomenon.</p>

<p>Curious names of months, of a kind which we have
hardly met with hitherto, are found in the comparatively highly
civilised Hausa states (Kano, Sokoto), where the Arabic and
Julian names for the months are also known. 1 (January),
<i>wata-n-tshika-n-shekara</i>, or <i>tshiki</i>, ‘month of the filling of the
belly’, since much food is eaten, especially at full moon, or
<i>wata-n-wauwo</i>, month of the <i>wauwo</i>-game (with torches); 2,
<i>wata-n-gani</i>, month of the <i>gani</i>-game; 3, <i>wata-n-takutika</i>, month
of the <i>takutika</i>-game, or <i>wata-n-takalufu</i>; 4, <i>ware-ware-n-farin</i>;
5, <i>ware-ware-n-biu</i>; 6, <i>ware-ware-n-aku</i>. <i>Ware-ware</i> is the
name of a small bird which builds its nest in a hole in the
ground; it is therefore doubtful to which element it belongs.
And so it is with these three months, April, May, June, in
which no games take place, so that it was not known where
to place them; for this reason they are called the 1st, 2nd,
and 3rd <i>ware-ware</i>. The word also denotes a person who
talks now one way, now another, a doubtful person. 7, <i>wata-n-azumi-n-tsofafi</i>,
month of the fast of the old people; 8, <i>wata-n-sha
rua-n-tsofafi</i>, month of the old people’s water-drinking; 9,
<i>wata-n-azumi</i>, month of fasting; 10, <i>wata-n-karama-n-salla</i>, month
of the little <i>salla</i> festival; 11, <i>wata-n-bawa-n-salloli</i>, month of
the slaves, in this month all (but especially the slaves) have
much work for the festival of the following month; 12, <i>wata-n-baba-n-salla</i>,
month of the great <i>salla</i> festival, or <i>wata-n-laiya</i>,
month of the slaughtering of the lamb. The festivals,
especially the <i>salla</i> festivals, do not always take place in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
months named after them: the time is determined by the priests
in accordance with the position of the moon (<i>wata</i> = ‘moon,’
‘month’)<a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a>. This is an artificial system which was probably
created with a leaning towards the Arabic months. In Edo too
the familiar names of months are borrowed from the ceremonies
that take place at different times<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a>.</p>

<p>Madagascar has a comparatively highly developed civilisation
in which various influences cross. The Merina have
the Arabic months. The history of the native calendar is said
to be very complicated: Grandidier in a detailed discussion
seeks to prove that the Malgassian year, which is commonly
held to be a lunar year, is a solar or lunisolar one, and on
the strength of certain resemblances in the names of the
months derives the calendar from S. India. I give the principal
data. Grandidier says that one reason for believing that
the Malgassian calendar is a solar one is the fact that it is in
reality agricultural. In 1638 Cauche says that the Malgassi divide
their year into 4 seasons and 12 lunar months, with
some intercalary days. The year is for them the time which
elapses between two phases of the vegetation; for greater
convenience they divide it into twelve lunar months, without
caring much about the number of days composing these months,
as is rightly said of the Antandroy by Vacher<a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a>, who gives the
following list, which is almost identical with that compiled by
Grandidier himself in the south-east, at Iavibola, in 1866. The
months have names and epithets: the latter are explained. 1,
millet is cut; 2, winter begins; 3, the beans flower; 4, the
tamarinds of the north are ripe; 5, the leaves fall; 6, tamarinds
and beans are ripe; 7, the <i>Cythere</i>-tree flowers; 8, the
bulls seek the shade of the <i>sakoa</i>; 9, the guinea-fowls sleep;
10, the rain rots the ropes (with which the calves are fastened);
11, the gourds flower; 12, the grains of the <i>fano</i> are
ripe. Rowlands<a id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> had already remarked that the Betsileo months
depend more upon the time of the sowing and reaping of the
rice and upon the flowering of certain plants than upon the phases<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
of the moon, and that the agreement with the months of the
Merina (i. e. the Arabic months) is only approximate. The same
applies to the calendar of the Sakalava, the Bara, the Tanala,
and the Sihanaka, which is identical with that of the Betsileo.
What is here said about the calendars of the peoples of the
south and the centre of the island is also true of the calendars
of the northern and eastern peoples<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a>. To me it seems
as though we have here a series of months of the ordinary
type, in which the months are named and at the same time
fixed with reference to the seasons, although I do not presume
to decide upon the complicated question of the Malgassian
calendar. There remains one possibility, viz. that the ‘months’
are seasons with no relation to the moon, but this possibility
does not seem to have been seriously considered by those who
can make use of the sources, which are only to be got at with
extreme difficulty.</p>

<p>Among the primitive peoples of the East Asiatic peninsula
the seasons of the agricultural year are very much employed;
in comparison with them the moon-month plays no
important part. Moreover Indian and Islamite influences have
penetrated deeply: the calendar in use arises from these. The
facts are well illustrated by a notice from the Malay Peninsula.
There are three ways of reckoning the months, (1) the
Arabian, 29 and 30 days alternately, (2) the Persian, 30 days,
and (3) that of Rum, 31 days; the first is the common method.
Some few, with greater accuracy, calculate their year at 354
days 8 hours, intercalating every 3 years 24 hours, or one
day, to make up the deficiency, and 33 days for the difference
between the solar and the lunar years. But the majority of
the lower classes estimate their year by the fruit seasons and
by their crops of rice only. Many, however, obstinately adhere
to the lunar month and plant their paddy at the annual return
of the lunar month<a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a>. The Guru of Sumatra know a division
of the year into twelve months of 30 days each; the months,
with the exception of the last two, are denoted by numbers<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a>.
They are therefore calendar months, not moon-months, and are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
a foreign acquisition. Among the Kayan the month, or, as
they say, the moon, plays a greater part than the year: of
the latter hardly anyone knows properly how many moons it
contains. Commonly they reckon 1 to 2 moons for the sowing,
five for the time which the rice needs to ripen, 2 to 3 for the
harvest, and three up to the next sowing. The different months
have no special names among the Bahau<a id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a>. The time-reckoning
of Sumatra, Java, and Bali shews a prevailing foreign
(Indian or Islamite) influence. It is to be noted that among
many peoples the first ten months are numbered, while the
last two have names. In Bali these two names are Sanskrit
words<a id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a>.</p>

<p>For Timor two lists of moon-months are given, the one
from Bibiçuçu, the other from Samoro. The names are in
some cases the same, they are not translated and perhaps
cannot be explained, but they indicate the occupations of the
months. 1, <i>funu</i>, <i>leet ali</i>, about October, <i>vater</i>, maize, is planted
and mountain rice sown; 2, <i>fahi</i>, the fields are weeded; 3,
<i>naru</i>, ‘the great month’, the maize flowers, heavy rain; 4, <i>fotan</i>,
<i>tora</i>, the former word probably a corruption of the Malay
<i>potong</i>, the cutting or harvest month: the maize is housed and
a harvest sacrifice offered; 5, <i>madauk</i>, harvest of the mountain-rice;
6, <i>wani</i>, honey and wax are collected; 7, <i>uhi</i>, <i>uhi
böot</i>, probably a corruption of <i>ubi</i>, sweet potato, these are now
dug up and collected; 8, <i>madai böot</i>, <i>uhi kiik</i>, fogs and heavy
rain; 9, <i>madai kiik</i>, <i>lakubutik</i>, little rain: during both these
months little work can be done; 10, <i>lakubutik böot</i>, <i>madai</i>,
still showers; 11, <i><ins class="corr" id="tn-207" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'lakabutik kiik'">
lakubutik kiik</ins></i>, <i>funu</i>, very hot, only in this
month is gold sought for; 12, <i>leet</i>, <i>leet manuluk</i>, hot: the grass
is burnt off and the ground prepared for maize-planting<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a>. It
is interesting to note how the names have departed from a
common foundation: two names (<i>funu</i>, <i>madai</i>) denote different
months. Note also the pairs of months in both lists.</p>

<p>The Kiwai Papuans, who are well acquainted with the
stars, have a very interesting list of months, compiled from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
names of stars and, as it seems, of natural objects. Accurate
information about this list has very kindly been personally
communicated to me by Landtman<a id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a>. The year is divided
into two parts in accordance with the monsoons<a id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a>. The
time of the S. E. monsoon (<i>uro</i>) embraces the months:&mdash;1,
<i>keke</i> (Achernar, our April); 2, <i>utiamo</i> (the Pleiades); 3, <i>sengerai</i>
(Orion); 4, <i>koidjugubo</i> (Capella, Sirius, and Canopus together);
5, <i>wapi</i>; 6, <i>hopukoruho</i>; 7, <i>abu</i>; and 8, <i>tagai</i> (Crux). In
the transitional period comes 9, <i>karongo</i> (Antares). The time
of the N. W. monsoon (<i>hurama</i>) includes:&mdash;10, <i>naramu-dubu</i>
(Vega); 11, <i>nirira-dubu</i> (Altair); 12, <i>goibaru</i>; 13, <i>korubutu</i>.
Each month, in the language of the natives called ‘moon’, is
connected with a definite constellation, as is shewn above, and
it is to be presumed that this constellation is properly the one
that is to sink down to the western horizon during the month
in question. Perfect accuracy does not however prevail in
this nomenclature, but several adaptations have been made.
(This is natural and necessary, on account of the dislocation
of the lunar months with regard to the solar year). Even in
the matter of the succession of the months different statements
were made, this no doubt being due to the fact that all the
natives were not equally masters of the calendar. The statements
fluctuate as to whether <i>karongo</i> is the last month of the
<i>uro</i> or the first of the <i>hurama</i>. (The fluctuation is natural,
since this month falls in the time of transition between the
two). In any case this month, like <i>keke</i>, the first of the <i>uro</i>,
comes to have a special meaning. It seems to be somewhat
uncertain whether <i>koidjugubo</i> exists as the name of a special
month or whether the word only denotes a constellation related
to the months <i>wapi</i>, <i>hopukoruho</i>, and <i>abu</i>. The time of
the <i>koidjugubo</i> is that in which the S. E. monsoon blows hardest.
The corresponding middle month in <i>hurama</i> is <i>goibaru</i>.
<i>Baidamu</i> (‘the Shark’), the Great Bear, is also related to a
certain period during the S. E. monsoon, particularly to <i>hopukoruho</i>,
in which according to certain statements the head
sets, and to <i>abu</i>, in which the back fin and the tail set. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
setting of each of the various parts of the body of the Shark
in the west is accompanied by storms and rain, which arise
in the period of the S. E. monsoon. When the Shark is no
longer to be seen at evening, and after both its eyes have
emerged in the east at morning, the period of the <i>tagai-karongo</i>
begins, in which the sea-turtles are caught, and the time
of the N. W. monsoon is at hand. The turtles are caught
more particularly during the time of their copulation, and this
begins in <i>abu</i>, occasionally in <i>tagai</i>, reaches its height in <i>karongo</i>,
and finishes in <i>naramu-dubu</i>. The planting of tubers
also takes place in definite months. Unfortunately the meaning
of the names that do not refer to constellations is not
in all cases clear. <i>Wapi</i> in one Torres Straits dialect is said
to mean ‘fish’, and the name is said to refer to the fact that
this time is especially favourable for fishing, since the fish are
then particularly stupid and easy to catch with the fish-spear.
<i>Hopukoruho</i> is the name of an earth-wasp: colonies of these
insects dig holes in the ground. (Do they appear in particularly
great numbers in this month?). <i>Hopu</i> means ‘earth’, and
<i>koruho</i> ‘to eat’. This month is held to be especially dangerous:
men are exposed to sickness and death and are bitten
by serpents, the canoes suffer shipwreck. It is also expressly
stated that the name of the month refers to death and burial.
The sense of <i>abu</i> is quite uncertain. <i>Abu</i> means ‘ford’ in a
creek: the name may perhaps refer to the beginning of the transition
to the period of the following monsoon. (Or does it refer
to the fact that the fords at the end of the dry season are
particularly easy to pass?). The sense of <i>goibaru</i> is also quite
uncertain, even, as it appears, among the natives. (No statement
as to the meaning of <i>karubuti</i> is given). <i>Karongo</i>,
according to the meaning of the word, is said to refer to the
transition from <i>hurama</i> to <i>uro</i>. <i>Koidjugubo</i> means ‘great constellation’.</p>

<p>For the Melanesians well developed series of months are
given: the very instructive statement of Codrington will be
found in the next chapter.<a id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> For the Carolines two lists of
names are given, from Lamotrek and from Yap<a id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a>; but they are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
of no use to us, since they only give twelve names without
any explanation. But the list for the Mortlock Islands, a group
included in the Carolines, is of great interest, since every
month is named after a constellation and therefore is also regulated
by it. The names are:&mdash;1, <i>yis</i>, Leo; 2, <i>soropuel</i>, Corvus;
3, <i>aramoi</i>, Arcturus; 4, <i>tumur</i>, Scorpio; 5, <i>mei-sik</i>, ν, ξ, ο
Herculis; 6, <i>meilap</i>, Aquila; 7, <i>sota</i>, Equuleus; 8, <i>la</i>, Pegasus;
9, <i>ku</i>, Aries; 10, <i>mariher</i>, the Pleiades; 11, <i>un-allual</i>, <i>elluel</i>,
Aldebaran and Orion; 12, <i>mau</i>, Sirius<a id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a>. The same system,
with names in some cases the same, is given for the southernmost
group of the Carolines, the St. David’s Islands<a id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a>. The
months of the Fijians, beginning at February, are:&mdash;1, <i>sese-ni-ngasau
lailai</i>; 2, <i>s.-n.-n.-levu</i>; 3, <i>vulai-mbotambota</i>; 4, <i>v.-kelikeli</i>;
5, <i>v.-were-were</i>; 6, <i>kawakatangare</i>; 7, <i>kawawaka-lailai</i>;
8, <i>k.-levu</i>; 9, <i>mbalolo-lailai</i>; 10, <i>m.-levu</i>; 11, <i>nunga-lailai</i>; 12,
<i>n.-levu</i><a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a>. The names are not explained, but from the glossary<a id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a>
we learn that <i>vula</i> means ‘moon’ and ‘month’, <i>se-ni-ngasau</i>
‘flower of the reed’, <i>mbota</i> ‘to share out, distribute’, <i>keli</i>
‘to dig’, <i>were</i> ‘to till the ground’, <i>kawa</i> ‘offspring, posterity’,
<i>waka</i> ‘root’, <i>nunga</i> is the name of a fish, <i>mbalolo</i> is the familiar
palolo, which is a favourite delicacy all over Polynesia,
<i>levu</i> = ‘big’, <i>lailai</i> = ‘little’. In so far as the meaning of the
names is to be perceived, therefore, they relate to the business
of agriculture and fishing. Here also we meet the already
familiar phenomenon in which several months have
the same name, and are distinguished by the addition of ‘big’
and ‘little’.</p>

<p>For the Polynesians many series of months are reported:
some of these have 13, others 12 months. The Maoris of New
Zealand count 13, and are distinguished from all others in only
numbering, not naming, the first ten. According to H. Williams
the months are counted from the beginning of the <i>kumara</i>-planting,
and are only denoted by numbers; in the tenth month
the harvest takes place, and also the feast of the dead, <i>ha-hunga</i>,
which for this reason also serves as a designation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
the year, but after that no further months are counted, up to
the first<a id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a>. This last statement must be regarded with suspicion,
since other sources give not indeed numbers but names
for the last three months and the points of reference. As an
example of the nomenclature I give <i>marama-to-ke-ngahuru</i>,
‘the tenth month’. The eleventh has the same name with the
addition of <i>hauhake kumare</i>, to dig up, harvest <i>kumara</i>; the
twelfth and thirteenth are called respectively <i>ko-te-paengwawa</i>
and <i>ko-te-tahi-o-pipiri</i>, which names are unfortunately not
translated. <i>Pipiri</i> recurs as the name of a month in the
Society Islands and Tahiti; there it is said that the name refers
to a certain thriftiness or stinginess, perhaps in the supply
of fruit<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a>. But the numbering of the names of the New Zealand
months is certainly a later phenomenon, since the cognate
tribes everywhere have proper names, nor do the months
on this account lose their connexion with the phenomena of
Nature. Although they were not named from the latter, they
were regulated by them. Each moon is distinguished by the
rising of stars, the flowering of certain plants, the arrival of
migratory birds, etc. I give a list of these points of reference,
beginning at June: unfortunately the names of stars are
not identified by our authority. 1, <i>puanga</i>, the great winter
star, rises early in the morning, and also denotes the beginning
of winter: <i>matariki</i>, <i>tapuapua</i>, <i>wakaahu te ra o tainu</i> are
also in the ascendant; 2, <i>wakaau</i>, <i>waakaahu nuku</i>, <i>w. rangi</i>, <i>w.
papa</i>, <i>w. kerekere</i>, <i>kopu</i>, <i>tautoru</i>; 3, <i>taka-pou-poto</i>, <i>mangere</i>,
<i>kaiwaka</i>, spring begins, the <i>karaka</i> and <i>hou</i> flower; 4, <i>taka-pou-tawahi</i>,
it begins to be warm, cultivation commences, the
<i>kowai</i>, <i>kotuku tuku</i>, and <i>rangiora</i> trees flower, a rainy month;
5, <i>kumara</i> is planted, the <i>tawera</i> is ripe, the cuckoo, <i>koekoea</i>,
arrives, the windy month, corresponding with our March, hence
the name <i>te rakihi</i>, the noisy or windy period; 6, <i>te wakumu</i>,
the <i>rewarewa</i> flowers; 7, <i>nga tapuae</i>, the <i>rata</i> flowers; 8, <i>uruao
rangawhenua</i>, <i>rehu</i> is the great summer star, the star <i>rangewhenua</i>,
an ancestor, is said to rule the days, and <i>uruao</i> the
nights of this month, the <i>karaka</i> flowers; 9, <i>rehua</i>, <i>ko ruruau</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
the dry and scarce month; 10, <i>rehua</i>, <i>matiti</i> (indicates the
autumn), <i>ngahuru</i>, the harvest month for the <i>kumara</i>; 11, <i>te
kahui-rua-mahu</i>, the days grow cold, the cuckoo leaves; 12, <i>kai
waka</i>, <i>patu-tahi matariki</i>, the winter-star <i>koero</i> is the chief
star of this month; 13, <i>tahi ngungu</i>, the grumbling month,
little food, bad weather, smoky houses, watery eyes, constant
quarrels<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a>. There are some descriptions of the months which
also seem to be their names. Taylor’s statement that the twelfth
month often passes unnoticed deserves attention.</p>

<p>Of Tonga it is noted that the names of the months are
scarcely known to any except those who work on the plantations:
the order of their succession is not quite clear. The
months are often grouped in pairs, <i>mooa</i> meaning the first,
<i>mooi</i> the second. 1, <i>liha-mooa</i>, 2, <i>l.-mooi</i>, <i>liha</i> means ‘nit’, but
is not connected by the author with the name of the month;
3, <i>vy-mooa</i>, 4, <i>vy-mooi</i>, <i>vy</i> = ‘watery’, ‘rainy’; 5, <i>hilinga gele-gele</i>:
<i>hilinga</i> is said to be a corruption of <i>hilianga</i>, ‘end, termination’,
<i>gele-gele</i> = ‘dig’, because in this month they cease
digging the ground for planting yams; 6, <i>tanoo manga</i>, <i>tanoo</i>
= ‘to overwhelm, to bury’, <i>manga</i> = anything open, diverging,
fork-shaped; 7, <i>oolooenga</i>; 8, <i>hilinga mea</i>, ‘the end of
things’, the month in which the principal agricultural work of
the season is finished; 9, <i>fucca afoo moooi</i>, <i>moooi</i> = ‘to live,
recover’; 10, <i>fucca afoo mote</i>, <i>mote</i> = ‘to die, wither’; 11,
<i>oolooagi mote</i>, <i>oolooagi</i> = ‘the first’; 12, <i>fooa fenike anga</i>; 13,
<i>mahina tow</i>, <i>mahina</i> = ‘moon’, <i>tow</i> = the end of anything<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a>. On
the Society Islands the people were not unanimous as to the
beginning of the year, nor as to the names of the months,
each island having a computation peculiar to itself. The series
of months adopted by King Pomare and the reigning family
was:&mdash;1, <i>avarehu</i>, the new moon that appears about the
summer (viz. our winter) solstice at Tahiti; 2, <i>faaahu</i>, the season
of plenty; 3, <i>pipiri</i>; 4, <i>taaoa</i>, the season of scarcity begins;
5, <i>aununu</i>; 6, <i>apaapa</i>; 7, <i>paroro mua</i>; 8, <i>paroro muri</i>; 9, <i>muriaha</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
10, <i>hiaia</i>; 11, <i>tema</i>, the season of scarcity ends; 12,
<i>te-eri</i>, the young bread-fruit begins to flower; 13, <i>te-tai</i>, the
bread-fruit is nearly ripe. Another computation commenced
the year at the month <i>apaapa</i>, about the middle of May, and
gave different names to several of the months<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a>. Another older
list gives the following series from Tahiti:&mdash;1, <i>o-porori-o-mua</i>,
March, the first hunger or scarcity; 2, <i>o-porori-o-muri</i>,
‘the last scarcity’, which agrees to some extent with the facts,
since the bread-fruit is scarcest just when it is ripening, as at
that time it is used for <i>mahei</i>, sour dough; 3, <i>mureha</i>; 4, <i>uhi-eya</i>,
has certainly a reference to catching fish with a hook;
5, <i>hurri-ama</i>; 6, <i>tauwa</i>; 7, <i>hurri-erre-erre</i>; 8, <i>o-te-ari</i>, probably
so called from the young cocoa-nuts, which just then are very
numerous; 9, <i>o-te-tai</i>, contains an allusion to the sea; 10, <i>wa-rehu</i>;
11, <i>wä-ahau</i>, refers to the cloth made from the mulberry
bark; 12, <i>pipirri</i>, refers to a certain thriftiness or stinginess,
perhaps in the supply of fruit; 13, <i>e-u-nunu</i><a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a>. For the Marquesas
Islands (Futuhiwa) I know only a bare enumeration of
13 names of months<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a>.</p>

<p>For Samoa there is more information. I give von Bülow’s
list:&mdash;1 (Oct.-Nov.), <i>palolo</i> or <i>taumafa mua</i>, ‘there is
for the first time abundance for all’: bananas, bread-fruit, and
taro are ripe, the month provides much fish; 2, <i>toe taumafa</i>,
‘there is once more abundance’, the harvest is still not ended;
3, <i>utuvamua</i>, ‘it is uninterrupted’, new crops of other fruit
have not yet appeared; 4, <i>toe utuva</i>, ‘still uninterrupted’; 5,
<i>faaafu</i>, ‘the leaves of the yam plant get dry’, i. e. the root is
ripe; 6, <i>lo</i>, ‘the staff for the harvest of the bread-fruit’, sc. ‘is
brought into play’; 7, <i>aununu</i>, ‘the making of the arrowroot into
starch’, the root is now ripe; 8, <i>oloumanu</i>, ‘the cage of the
birds’ (is prepared), in which to tame the wild pigeons caught
in nets, after some of their wing-feathers have been removed;
9, <i>palolo-mua</i>, the first <i>palolo</i> fishing: the appearance of the
palolo formerly took place in various months, since there are
still islands in which palolo is found in the last quarter of every
month; 10, <i>toe palolo</i> or <i>palolomoli</i>, ‘repeated last palolo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
fishing’, from the fishing at the end of the year in October or
the end of September, according to the island; 11, <i>mulifa</i>,
‘the banana-pole’ (is hewn down), i. e. the bananas are ripe;
12, <i>lotuaga</i>, ‘the <i>lo</i> is laid to rest’, i. e. the bread-fruit harvest
is over<a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a>. All the lists agree in giving only twelve months:
the seasons are two in number. For the Bowditch Island a
list of twelve names is given without explanation; the names
are in a great measure the same as the Samoan. The author
adds:&mdash;It seems as though <i>vainoa</i>, month no. 9, is the leapmonth,
but there was no name for the eleventh month, corresponding
to our March<a id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a>.</p>

<p>For the Sandwich Islands abundant material exists, more
particularly in the work of the native writer, Malo. I give the
list commonly found in other authors also<a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a>, together with the
explanations which Malo has obtained from old Hawaiians well
versed in the calendar, in the first place those of O. K. Kapule
of Kaluaha, Molokai, and secondly, in the case of some months,
those of Kaunamoa, of whose dwelling-place we are told nothing
more than that he was a Hawaiian. 1, <i>ikuwa</i> (January), so
named from the frequent occurrence of thunder-storms, <i>wa-wa</i>,
‘to reverberate, to stun the ear’: the noisy month, clamor of
ocean, thunder, storm; 2, <i>hina-ia-eleele</i>, from the frequent over-casting
and darkening (<i>eleele</i>) of the heavens; 3, <i>welo</i>, because
the rays of the sun then begin to shoot forth (<i>welo</i>) more
vigorously: the leaves are torn to shreds by the <i>enuhe</i>, a kind
of worm; 4, <i>makalii</i> (the Pleiades); 5, <i>ka-elo</i>, so named because
the sweet potatoes burst out of the hill, or overflowed the
basket; 6, <i>kau-lua</i>, from the coupling together of two canoes
(<i>kau-lua</i>): the two stars called <i>kau-lua</i> then rose in the east;
7, <i>nana</i>, from the fact that a canoe then floated (<i>nana</i>, <i>lana</i>)
quietly on the calm sea: the young birds then stir and rustle about
(<i>nana-na</i>) in their nests and coverts; 8, <i>ikiiki</i>, the hot month (<i>ikiki</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
or <i>ikiiki</i>, ‘hot and stuffy’): ‘hot and sticky’, from being shut up
indoors, by weather; 9, <i>kaa-ona</i>, because then the sand-banks
begin to shift in the ocean, <i>ona</i> is said to be another word
for <i>one</i>, ‘sand’: (dry) sugar-canes, flower-stalks, etc., which have
been put away in the top of the house, have now become very dry;
10, <i>hili-na-ehu</i>, from the mists that floated up from the sea; 11,
<i>hili-na-ma</i>, because it was necessary to keep the canoes well
lashed (<i>hili</i>); 12, <i>welehu</i>, so named from the abundance of ashes
(<i>lehu</i>) that were to be found in the fire-places at this time.
Malo gives six other lists, two for Hawaii, one each for Molakai,
Oahu, Kauai, and Maui. The differences in the order
of the months already mentioned are sometimes great, and
some new names occur. The former circumstance is doubtless
to be explained by the fact that under European influence the
native months early passed out of use and were forgotten, and
the right order has not been certainly retained in the memory.
Some of these explanations are obvious improvisations, in some
cases one of the two explanations manifestly shews itself to be
the correct one. This proves that the names of the months
are so old that the original meaning has been lost. The forgetting
of the native months is also responsible for the insufficiency
of the information for other islands. Malayan philology
might perhaps be able to go farther, if it took up the
matter. But where the meaning is clear, it everywhere has
reference to the seasons, their occupations and climatic conditions,
and to the stars; the Polynesian names of months are in
no way different from those of all other primitive or barbaric
peoples.</p>

<p>The conclusion to be drawn from our investigation of
the names and series of the months is therefore the following.
In order that the month may be distinguished from others it
is named after an occupation or natural phase which takes
place while the month lasts, being described commonly by
means of the addition ‘moon of the &mdash;’, but not seldom simply
by the name of the natural phase or the occupation respectively.
Any natural phase or occupation can originally give
its name to a month, and hence arises an indefinite number
of such terms. When any period of the year is without important<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
natural phases and occupations, the months in this
period are not named. At first, therefore, the names of the
months are of an occasional, incidental character: the orientation
of them follows from the general acquaintance with
the phases and occupations of the natural year. As the result
of a gradual selection in the daily usage of the names a less
unstable, and in the end quite fixed, series of months is formed,
which on account of the length of the natural year must comprise
12 to 13 months. The result is a difficulty which formerly
was not felt, owing to the fluctuating character of
the names of months, for the natural phases and the moons
are pushed out of their mutual relationship, and this naturally
leads to the question how many months the year includes, i. e.
to the necessity of the intercalation. For the moon-month,
which begins with the new moon, is a natural unity, which
cannot be broken up.</p>

<span class="fs70">CONCLUSIONS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy1">Whoever has had patience to read through the material
collected in the previous chapter will now no doubt
be clear as to the process by which the cycle of months arose. The
necessity was felt of distinguishing the months, of marking them.
After the fashion of primitive man this was done, not by means
of an abstract enumeration, but by some concrete reference.
But the relation to a solitary historical event, by which rather
more highly civilised peoples denote the years, can hardly, or
only in isolated instances, be applied to the month: for the
life of primitive peoples is very monotonous, and is not so rich
in events which make an impression upon the mind that one
of these will occur in every month, and even supposing that
such events could be found, the months in a human life are
too numerous for it to be possible to keep a series of this nature
in mind. A second circumstance also proved decisive. The
moon, whose phases always recur with regularity, served better
than anything else to determine the date of any future event
within a shorter period. The primitive peoples, with their undeveloped
faculty of counting, could in this fashion numerically
determine only a couple of months before or after the time of
the moon that was then visible in the heavens. This is what
we must understand by the statement made for the western
tribe of the Torres Straits, viz. that they had no division of
the year into months or days and never numbered the years,
in view of the following statement that they commonly counted
time in ‘suns’, i. e. days, and ‘moons’, i. e. months<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a>. That is,
they numbered two or three months, but had no series of months.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
The same initial stage is found also on the Australian continent.
The natives of Central Australia reckon time by moon-phases,
moons, and in the case of a longer period by seasons<a id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a>. The
Kakadu of Northern Territory reckon in moons and seasons,
otherwise everything is more or less vague with the exception
of the present and the immediate past and future<a id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a>.</p>

<p>Primitive man does not get very far in this fashion. In
accordance with his custom and his whole habits of thought
he must have some concrete factor to enable him to conceive
of the different moons. This is found in the fact that the
moon covers a part of the natural year. Herein lies a connexion
which constantly recurs. The moons were therefore
distinguished and named with reference to the phenomena of
the natural year, to the phases of nature and to the occupations,
labours, and conditions determined by them, and further
to the risings of the stars. Within the series of from twelve
to thirteen moons the month was determined by these means.
Or, expressed somewhat differently, seasons and moons were
mutually connected.</p>

<p>Originally this grouping together of the months was only
incidental. The original state of affairs is well illustrated by
the detailed description given by Codrington for the Melanesians:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is impossible to fit the native succession of moons into
a solar year, months have their names from what is done and
what happens when the moon appears and while it lasts; the
same moon has different names. If all the names of moons
in use in one language were set in order the periods of time
would overlap, and the native year would be artificially made
up of 20 or 30 months. The moons and seasons of Mota in
the Banks’ Islands may serve as an example. The garden
work of the year is the principal guide to the arrangement,
the succession of 1, clearing garden ground, <i>uma</i>, 2, cutting
down the trees, <i>tara</i>, 3, turning over and piling up the stuff,
<i>rakasag</i>, 4, burning it, <i>sing</i>, 5, digging the holes for yams,
<i>nur</i>, and planting, <i>riv</i>. Then follows the care of the yam
plants till the harvest, after which preparation for the next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
crop begins again. At the same time the regular winds and
calms are observed, the spring of grass, the conspicuous flowering
of certain trees, the bursting into leaf of the few deciduous
trees. When a certain grass, <i>magoto</i>, springs, the
winter, as it must be called, is over; when the erythrina, <i>rara</i>,
is in flower, it is the cool season; <i>magoto</i>, therefore, and <i>rara</i>
are names of seasons in native use, and answer roughly to
summer and winter. The strange and exciting appearance of
the palolo, <i>un</i>, sets a wide mark on the seasons. The April moon
coincides pretty well with the time of the <i>magoto qaro</i>, the
fresh grass; clearing, <i>uma</i>, of gardens goes on, the trade wind
is steady. This is followed by the <i>magoto rango</i>, the withered
grass; both are months of cutting down trees in the gardens,
<i>vule taratara</i>, and in the latter the stuff is burnt. In July the
erythrina, <i>rara</i>, begins to flower; this is <i>nago rara</i>, the face
of winter; gardens are fenced, it is a moon of planting yams,
<i>vule vutvut</i>. Planting continues into August, when the erythrina
is in full flower, <i>tur rara</i>, the <i>gaviga</i>, Malay apple, flowering
at the same time; the S. E. wind, <i>gauna</i>, blows, the
yams begin to shoot and are stuck with reeds. In the next
month the erythrina puts out its leaves, it is the end of it,
<i>kere rara</i>; the yam vines run up the reeds and are trained,
<i>taur</i>, upon them; the reeds are broken and bent over, <i>ruqa</i>,
to let them run freely; the ground is kept clear of weeds; the
tendrils curl, and the tubers are well formed. Then come the
months of calm, when three moons are named from the <i>un</i>,
palolo: first the <i>un rig</i>, the little <i>un</i>, or the bitter, <i>un gogona</i>,
when at the full moon a few of the annelids appear. It is now
the <i>tau matua</i>, the season of maturity; yams can be taken up
and eaten, and if the weather is favourable, a second crop is
planted. The <i>un lava</i>, the great palolo, follows, when at the
full moon for one night the annelids appear on the reefs in
swarms; the whole population is on the beach, taking up the
<i>un</i> in every vessel and with every contrivance. This is the
moon of the yam harvest; the vines are cut, <i>goro</i>, and the
tubers very carefully taken up with digging-sticks to be stored.
A few <i>un</i> appear at the next moon, the <i>werei</i>, which may be
translated ‘the rump of the <i>un</i>’. In this moon they begin again<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
to <i>uma</i>, clear the gardens; the wind blows again from the west,
the <i>ganoi</i>, over Vanua Lava. It is now November or December,
the <i>togalau</i>-wind blows from the north-west, it is exceedingly
hot, fish die in the shallow pools, the reeds shoot up into
flower; it is the moon of shooting up, <i>vule wotgoro</i>. The next
month is the <i>vusiaru</i>, the wind beats upon the <i>casuarina</i>-trees
upon the cliffs, the next again is called <i>tetemavuru</i>, the wind
blows hard and drives off flying fragments from the seeded
reeds; these are hurricane months. The last in order is the
month that beats and rattles, <i>lamasag noronoro</i>, the dry reeds;
the wind blows strong and steady, work is begun again, they
<i>rakasag</i>, dry the rubbish of their clearings, and make ready
the fences for new gardens. By this time the heat is past,
the grass begins to spring again, and the winter months return”<a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a>.</p>

<p>According to another report the natives of New Britain
(Bismarck Archipelago) are still at the initial stage of the
development. They numbered the months of the monsoons,
five for each, and gave one month each to the two intervening
periods. They had no names for each month, but only for the
season. However they had terms for the planting and for the
digging-moon, i. e. the harvest<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a>.</p>

<p>Another example may serve to shew how near to one
another lists of months and seasons may under certain circumstances
come. The Chukchee divide the year into twelve
lunar months or ‘moons’. The year begins with the winter
solstice, the time of which is marked pretty accurately. The
dark interval between two moons is called ‘moon interval’.
The names are:&mdash;1, the old-buck month; 2, cold udder (month);
3, genuine udder (month); 4, calving month; 5, water (month);
6, making-leaves month; 7, warm month, or summer month;
8, rubbing-off velvet (antlers) month, or midsummer month;
9, light-frost month; 10, autumn month, or wild-reindeer rutting
month; 11, unexplained, perhaps ‘muscles of the back’, since it
is believed that the muscles in the back of the reindeer become
stronger in winter: also called ‘new-snow cover’; 12, shrinking
(days) month. The Koryak have different names in different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
localities, but most of them call the third and the fourth months
respectively the ‘false’ and the ‘true reindeer-birth month’. In
ordinary speech, however, the names of months often give place
to names of seasons, which are far more numerous than among
us. Those most commonly used are:&mdash;1, ‘in the extending’,
sc. of the days, corresponds approximately to the first month
of the year; 2, ‘in the lengthening’, corresponds to the second
month; 3, ‘during (the days) growing long’, lasts about six weeks,
until the reindeer begin to calve; 4, ‘in the calving-(time)’;
5, ‘in the new summer growing’; 6, ‘in the first summer’; 7, ‘in
the second summer’; 8, ‘in the middle summer’; 9, ‘with the
fresh air going out’; 10, ‘with the first light frost’; 11, ‘with the
new snow’; 12, ‘in the fall’; 13, ‘in the winter’<a id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a>. Certainly
these are seasons, and one of them has six weeks, but our
authority himself explains a couple of them by a comparison
with the moon-month. There are just thirteen of them, which,
if the number is more than an accident, is an accurate series
of months. In every case the addition of the word ‘moon’
would make the names descriptive of a month. The names in
both the lists just given are of a similar nature.</p>

<p>Few travellers and scholars have been so unfettered and
unprejudiced by our inherited ideas of the calendar as Codrington;
accordingly they have usually striven to establish a
proper series of months, or at least normal series. How much
is lost to view owing to this tendency can hardly be imagined,
but there are sufficient indications in the reports to point
to the fluctuating, manifold, and unstable nature of the primitive
naming of the months.</p>

<p>One of these indications is the great variability of the
names. Many peoples have remained at the stage at which a
fixed connexion between month and season does not exist:
every season&mdash;taking the word in its broadest sense&mdash;, every
natural event and occupation may be associated with a month.
If these relationships are treated as names of months, there
will arise a great number of names of months, which will vary
according to circumstances and to the whim of the speaker.
Thus it is said<a id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> of the Eskimos of the Behring Straits that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
very often different names are used to describe the same month,
when this month occurs at a time at which different occupations
or natural phenomena are in progress. That the situation
is, or at least was, the same among most peoples is shewn by
the numerous variants which are to be found even in the
preceding lists, and would certainly be much more numerous
if the authorities, in their efforts to establish a normal series,
had not passed them over. In the same fashion is to be explained
the next surprising phenomenon, viz. that certain
peoples, in the matter of the number of months in the year,
give a far greater number than twelve or thirteen. This is
not always to be set down to the inability to count. That
explanation serves when prominent Igorot declare that the
year has a hundred months<a id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a>, but not when the Kiowa number
14 or 15<a id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a>. The Hopi year too may have 14 months,
since the second part of October receives a special name<a id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a>.
Perhaps the month is halved, just as when among the Central
Eskimos the days of a certain month, which has only
twilight and no sun, receive one name, and the rest of the
month another<a id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a>. A traveller of the 18th century states that
the Tahitians reckon 14 months, and adds that it is a mystery
how they count them<a id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a>. But these traces are here seen to be
relics of an earlier state of affairs such as Codrington has
clearly described:&mdash;“Months have their names from what is
done and what happens when the moon appears and while it
lasts; the same moon has different names. If all the names of
moons in use in one language were set in order, the periods
of time would overlap, and the native year would be artificially
made up of 20 or 30 months”.</p>

<p>This fluctuating character of the nomenclature explains
the instability of the names of the months; when anything new
happens which is of importance for the life of the people, it
serves to describe a month. Thus the Lenope, after they migrated
inland, where no shads were found, renamed the shad-month
the sugar-refining month<a id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a>; and the Pima, after they had
learnt to cultivate wheat, named a month from the wheat harvest<a id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
The best evidence is the multiplicity and diversity of the
names of months, which is found everywhere, even among the
most closely related peoples and tribes, or different groups of
the same tribe, as is shewn by the above series of months
from beginning to end. Most significant and by no means
isolated is the case of the Cheyenne, different groups of whom
have separate names for the months. Since they are well
acquainted with the customs of the animals and roam over
wide areas, they easily recognise any name for a month, even
if they themselves do not use it. The reason for this is also
that the seasons, which serve as descriptions of the months,
are common to all and at once become intelligible<a id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a>. They
have not been fixed in a conventional series, as is the case
with the months as we conceive them; ours is the final point
of the development, which begins with a chaotic mass of names
of months.</p>

<p>We see that at this stage the number of months is indifferent:
the question how many months the year has simply
does not exist, and consequently there is no need to make
the series of moon-months fit into the solar year. There are
peoples who do not even extend the reckoning by moons to
the whole year. There is a time ‘in which nothing happens’,
which is quite without interest and in which no one takes the
trouble to observe or name the moons. Such a period is e. g.
the depth of winter in the far north, when people only vegetate,
as well as they can. Among the tribes of the Kamchatka
river the tenth and last month is said to be as long as three
others<a id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a>. The Amansi, one of the Ibo-speaking tribes, reckon
ten months and an <i>evulevu</i> (idiot, nothing, empty month)<a id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a>. More
often we find series of months with less than twelve names.
The inhabitants of the Marquesas Islands had a ten-month
year, although as well as this they knew the complete year,
which was reckoned and named according to the Pleiades<a id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a>.
Even the Maoris are said to have counted no more months after
the tenth<a id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a>. The Yurak Samoyedes and the Tunguses of the
Amur count only eleven months, the northern Kamchadales ten<a id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
The Yeneseisk Ostiaks name only the months of one half of
the year, the seven winter months<a id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a>, and so do many Indian
tribes. The Bannock have no names for the months of the
warm season of the year<a id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a>. Many Cheyenne tribes have only
six months with names<a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a>; the present condition of the calendar
of the Hopi and Zuñi points to the fact that this was really
the case with these tribes also<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a>. The Diegueño of S. California
have only six months<a id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a>. Even where a full series of
months has arisen, there are traces of this earlier state of
affairs. Thus the Omaha have one month ‘in which nothing
happens’<a id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a>. Of the 13 months of the Upper Wellé those occupying
the 7th and 13th positions have no names<a id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a>. Among
the Voguls of the Tawda three months seem to be unnamed<a id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a>.</p>

<p>A further very wide-spread phenomenon of the nomenclature
of the months&mdash;the pairs of months, in which two
months of the same name are distinguished as the big and the
little, the former and the latter, etc.&mdash;is due to the connecting
of the month with somewhat larger divisions of the natural
year, covering a period of about two months. Thus the
Tchuvashes have a very steep month and a month of little
steepness, the Ugric Ostiaks a big and a little winter-ridge
month, the Minusinsk Tatars a little and a big cold, the Karagasses
a frost month and a big frost month, the Samoyedes a
first and a big dark month, the Voguls a little and a big
autumn-hunting month, perhaps also a little and a big mid-summer
month, the Thlinkits a month before, and a month
when, everything hatches, the Indians in De la Potherie a
first and a second moon in which the bear brings forth her
young, the Kiowa a little bud-moon and a bud-moon, the
latter sometimes with ‘big’ added, the Creek Indians a little
and a big ripening moon, a little and a big chestnut moon, a
big and a little winter, the latter also called ‘little brother of
big winter’ (note the inverted order in this case), a little and
a big spring. The Seminole have four pairs of months, in three
the first is distinguished as the little, e. g. little and big mulberry
moon, but on the other hand the big winter precedes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
the little; the Zuñi have a little and a big wind-month. Somewhat
similar are the pairs of months of the Pima, ‘leaves’ and
‘flowers’ of the cottonwood and mesquite respectively. The
Nandi of British East Africa have two pairs, ‘sacrifice’ and
‘second sacrifice’, ‘strong wind’ and ‘second strong wind’.
Compare also the two Basuto months <i>phupjoane</i>, ‘to begin to
swell’, from <i>phuphu</i>, and <i>phuphu</i>, ‘to swell’. The two series
of months from Timor shew more pairs. In the Polynesian
series pairs of months are equally frequent. In Tonga there
are two pairs, including a first and a second rainy month, on
the Society Islands there is a first and a second palolo month,
and so also in Samoa, in Tahiti a first and a last hunger. How
the pair so frequently occurring among the Siberian peoples,
little and big month, is to be explained is uncertain (cp. among
the Thlinkits ‘moon-child’ or young month, and big month).
It may be that something is to be understood, or perhaps they
are simply two months without names, which are distinguished
by the aid of the common epithets.</p>

<p>Such pairs of months exist where greater seasons are involved
in the determining of the moons, and they are in fact
convenient, since their use obviates the unfortunate circumstance
which has been a source of great confusion to primitive
peoples, viz. that a natural phase from which it is the
custom to name a month may fall on the border-line between
two moons. So long as the description of the months remains
quite fluctuating and occasional, this and similar inconveniences
do not make themselves felt, but a very natural development
leads to a conventionalising of the series of months.
In common speech a selection among the various names of months
unconsciously takes place, so that those prevail which relate
to more important occupations and natural phases. Thus arises
a fixed, or tolerably well fixed, series of months, such as appears
in most of the reports handed down to us.</p>

<h3>1. BABYLONIA.</h3>


<p class="drop-capy1">In the much disputed questions of the ancient Babylonian
astronomy and calendar the non-expert is in a situation of
despair: for whoever cannot himself make use of the sources
is referred to the often directly contradictory statements of the
experts. I cannot however shirk the task of investigating
whether in Babylonian calendric systems traces of the primitive
time-reckoning are not also to be found. Unfortunately I cannot
limit myself to matters upon which a certain unity of opinion
prevails, but must also touch upon burning questions, such as
the intercalation. What is here offered is in the nature of
things only an attempt: but I may perhaps be allowed to express
the hope that competent specialists, not led astray by
chronological hypotheses, may afterwards observe how far the
few but obvious characteristics of the primitive time-reckoning
recur also in the Babylonian system.</p>

<p>The multiplicity and variability of the names of the months
are found once more in ancient Sumer. In so comparatively late
a period as the kingdom of Ur (in the middle of the second
half of the third millenium B. C.) each minor state had its own
list of months, which I here reproduce, together with the
suggested explanations, chiefly from the latest work of Landsberger<a id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a>.
At this time there was in use in Nippur a list of
months the terms of which later served as general ideograms
for the months. The names are:&mdash;1, <i>bar-zag-gar(-ra)</i> month<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
of habitation or inhabitants of the sanctuary; 2, <i>gu(d)-si-sa</i>, the
name is derived by the Babylonians themselves from an agricultural
occupation, the driving of the irrigating-machine drawn
by oxen: the moderns connect this name with the <i>gu(d)-si-su</i>
festival celebrated in this month at Nippur; 3, <i>šeg-ga</i>, shortened
from <i>šeg-u-šub-ba-gar-ra</i>, ‘month in which the brick is laid in the
mould’; 4, <i>šu-kul-na</i>, probably ‘sowing-month’, although the time
does not fit: for displacements see <a href="#Page_261">below p. 261</a>; 5, <i>ne-ne-gar(-ra)</i>,
named from a festival; 6, <i>kin-<sup>d</sup> Inanna</i>, named from an Istar
festival; 7, <i>du(l)-azag(-ga)</i>, from a festival; 8, <i>apin-du-a</i>, ‘month
of the opening of the irrigation-pipes’, which fits very well with
the time of year; 9, <i>kan-kan-na</i>, probably ‘ploughing-month’,
which also agrees very well with the season; 10, <i>ab(-ba)-e(-a)</i>,
from a festival; 11, <i>aš-a(-an)</i>, ‘month of the spelt’; 12, <i>še-kin-kud-(du)</i>,
‘month of the corn-harvest’. There are therefore some
names of the familiar kind, taken from agricultural occupations,
but more are borrowed from festivals. It is very natural that
the list of months should be regulated by ecclesiastical points
of view, since Nippur was a great and very ancient centre of
the religious cult.</p>

<p>Most interesting are the months from Girsu (Lagash).
From the pre-Sargonic period about 25 names of months have
hitherto been found, of which only 8 or 9 persisted up to the
second and third periods. These 25 names of months are
divided by Landsberger into the following groups:&mdash;(1) occasional
names of months, under which he includes those which
are consciously named after the object or employment mentioned
in the document itself, or even improvised from the
domestic occupation in question. Four names are given but
are not translated. (2) isolated and foreign names of months:
‘month in which the shining (or white) star sinks down from
the culmination-point’, a type familiar to us; ‘month in which
the third people came from Uruk’, doubtless an accidental
description. Further, two months named from festivals at
Lagash. (3) agricultural by-names: <i>itu še-kin-kud-du</i>, see
above; <i>itu gur-dub-ba-a</i>, ‘month in which the granary is covered
with grain’; further a name not explained, perhaps identical
with the foregoing. (4) terms belonging to the religious cult.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
Of these no fewer than 17 exist, not counting those already
mentioned: they are nearly all named after festivals. Great
pains have been taken to arrange the months in their
position in the calendar, and the superfluous names have
been set down merely as doublets, since they have been judged
by the lists of months current among ourselves. When we
compare the terms with those of the primitive time-reckoning,
it becomes clear that the naming of the months is here in the
same fluctuating state as e. g. among the Melanesians. According
to circumstances, an agricultural occupation, the rising of
a star, a festival, etc., is seized upon in order to describe the
month. Certainly the months can be chronologically arranged,
but to draw up a fixed series from these 25 names is impossible,
even if tendencies towards the formation of such a series
already exist. The development tends in this direction in order
to facilitate a general understanding, and in the second
period, at the time of the kingdom of Akkad in the 28th to
26th centuries, a list of this nature occurs<a id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a>:&mdash;1, <i>itu ezen gan-maš</i>,
perhaps ‘month of the reckoning’, i. e. of the profits of
the agriculture, or ‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mois où la campagne resplendit</i>’; 2, <i>itu
ezen har-ra-ne-sar-sar</i>, ‘month in which the oxen work’; 3, <i>itu
ezen dingir ne-šu</i>, of uncertain meaning but connected with
the cult; 4, <i>itu šu-kul</i>, see above; 5, <i>itu ezen dim-ku</i>, month of
the feast in which the <i>dim</i> consecrated to the deity was eaten;
6, <i>itu ezen <sup>dingir</sup> Dumu-zi</i>, month of the Tammuz feast; 7,
<i>itu ur</i>; 8, <i>itu ezen <sup>dingir</sup> Bau</i>, month of the feast of the goddess
Bau; 9, <i>itu mu-šu-gab</i>, meaning uncertain; 10, <i>itu mes-en-du-še-a-na</i>
(?); 11, <i>itu ezen amar-a(-a)-si</i>, <i>amar</i> = ‘young brood’,
<i>a</i> = ‘water’, <i>si</i> = <i>malu</i> = ‘to be full’, and therefore probably
‘spawning month’; 12, <i>itu še-še-kin-a</i>, another form for <i>še-kin-kud</i>;
13, <i>itu ezen še-illa</i>, ‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mois où le blé monte</i>’, according to
Radau ‘grain grow(n)’, according to de Genouillac, whom Kugler
follows, ‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mois où on lève le blé pour les moutons</i>’: i. e. after
the corn has been trodden out on the threshing-floor by the
oxen, the stalks are taken up for the cattle. The list has
therefore thirteen months. Further, two points are to be noted.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
In the first place only eight months (nos. 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 11, 12,
and 13), or perhaps nine&mdash;if <i>itu ur</i> is to be regarded as an
abbreviation of <i>itu ga-udu-ur-(ra-)ka</i>&mdash;are taken over from the
preceding period. The multiplicity and instability of the names
of months were therefore at an earlier period still greater than
the known names indicate. In the second place the word <i>ezen</i>,
‘feast’, is a secondary addition to the names of the 2nd, 3rd,
13th, and probably the 4th months, that is to say, the
ecclesiastical point of view has penetrated into the nomenclature
of the months to such an extent that even months with
names borrowed from agricultural occupations are explained
anew by festivals. The third period is the time of Dungi and
his successors. The list of months differs only in that 7,
<i>itu ur</i>, was re-named as <i>itu ezen <sup>dingir</sup> Dungi</i>, and the tenth
month of the above list is missing, so that we have 10, <i>itu
amar-a-asi</i>; 11, <i>itu še-kin-kud</i>; 12, <i>itu se-illa</i>; in the intercalation
11 is doubled, <i>itu dir še-kin-kud</i>. The seventh month takes
its name from a festival celebrated in honour of the deified
king Dungi; it is therefore the oldest example of a naming of
a month from deified rulers which originates in the festivals
bound up with the cult; such names are familiar from the
Graeco-Roman period and examples still survive in the words
‘July’ and ‘August’. Still another version of this list exists in
the so-called syllabar of months, in which six series of names
of months are enumerated. This list is not completely preserved.
The most considerable deviation is that only two
months instead of three intervene between the months <i>šu-kul-na</i>
and <i>ezen <sup>d</sup> Bau</i>: the order of succession is therefore broken.
Landsberger conjectures that we have to do either with a later
form of the calendar from Lagash, at the time of the kings
of Larsa and Isin&mdash;afterwards the Nippur list was used, this
being employed everywhere, at least ideographically&mdash;or else
with a local offshoot. In any case the list affords valuable
evidence of the instability of the months.</p>

<p>In modern Drehem there is found a list of months in which
each month is allotted to an official of the cult, so that the
result is a monthly regulation of the cult. The list is assigned
to the town of Ur. 1, <i>maš-da-ku</i>, ‘month of the gazelle eating’,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
from a festival ceremony; 2, <i>šeš-da-ku</i>, and 3, <i>u-bi-ku</i>, borrowed
from religious festivals; 4, <i>ki-sig <sup>d</sup> Nin-a-zu</i>, month of the
mourning festival of Ninazu; 5, <i>ezen <sup>d</sup> Nin-a-zu</i>, month of
the (joyful) festival of Ninazu; 6, <i>a-ki-ti</i>, named from a
feast; 7, <i>ezen <sup>d</sup> Dungi</i>, see above; 8, <i>šu-eš-ša</i>, unexplained,
later ousted by <i><sup>itu</sup> ezen <sup>d</sup> Su- <sup>d</sup> Sin</i>; 9, <i>ezen-mah</i>, ‘month of
the high feast’; 10, <i>ezen-an-na</i>, month of the Anu feast; 11, <i>ezen
Me-ki-gal</i>, doubled in intercalation; 12, <i>še-kin-kud</i>. There are
also many variants. The names, with the exception of that of
the old harvest month, are all taken from feasts: the ecclesiastical
nomenclature has therefore been carried out very fully.</p>

<p>The list of months from Umma:&mdash;The months 1, 2, and
6 are borrowed from the Nippur list. Of undoubted religious
origin are:&mdash;9, <i><sup>d</sup> Ne-gun</i>; 10, <i>ezen <sup>d</sup> Dungi</i>; 12, <i><sup>d</sup> Dumu-zi</i>. 11
has the variant <i><sup>itu d</sup> Pap-u-e</i>. To none of the four local systems
can <i><sup>itu</sup> azag-šim</i> be allotted.</p>

<p>A fifth list is known only from the above-mentioned syllabar,
and is not certainly localised. The names of months refer
to festivals and religious ceremonies, and have not all been
completely preserved.</p>

<p>We have seen what a multiplicity prevails among the Sumerian
names of months. At the time of the dynasty of
Hammurabi the signs of the Nippur list are used as ideographic
signs of the months. The phonetic readings are known. The
names are the common ones which were also adopted by
the Jews in exile. The explanations are, according to Muss-Arnolt:&mdash;1,
<i>nisanu</i>, from <i>nesu</i> = ‘to stir, to move on, to leap’;
2, <i>airu</i>, from <i>aru</i>, ‘bright’, or <i>ir</i>, ‘to send out, to sprout’, and
therefore the month of blossoming and sprouting; 3, <i>sivanu</i>;
4, <i>duzu</i>, ‘son of life’; 5, <i>abu</i>, ‘hostile’ (on account of the heat);
6, <i>ululu</i>; 7, <i>tašritu</i>, ‘origin, beginning’; 8, <i>arah-samna</i>, ‘the eighth
month’; 9, <i>kislivu</i>; 10, <i>dhabitu</i>, ‘the gloomy month’; 11, <i>sabadhu</i>,
‘the destroyer’; 12, <i>addaru</i>, ‘the dark (month)’. The names
are therefore borrowed throughout from natural phenomena.
Numerous phonetic writings in legal documents are alone sufficient
to shew that, at least for Sippar, our common pronunciations
of the month-ideograms of this time were not the only
ones in use. Landsberger gives 12 other names, of which only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
a few can be explained. <i>Sibutim</i>, <i>sibutu</i> is the name for the
7th day and its festival, as the name of a month therefore,
carrying over the idea to the year, it is the <i>sibutu</i> of the
year; <i>ki-nu-ni</i>, ‘oven month’, because the oven must then be
heated; <i>arah ka-ti-ir-si-tim</i>, ‘hand of the underworld’, probably
something like ‘month of epidemics’. One or two are named
from gods. Therefore among the Semites of Babylonia also a
fixed series of months was formed only gradually, by selection,
and indeed under the influence of the Sumerian calendar from
which the ideograms were borrowed.</p>

<p>The Elamite calendar is known partly from the so-called
syllabar of months, and partly from documents<a id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a>: the latter
offer 13 names of which Hrozný tries to explain away the last
by identifying it with another. The names in the two sources
sometimes vary considerably, but are chiefly of Babylonian
origin. Several, according to Hrozný’s interpretations, refer
to the seasons: <i>še-ir(-i)-eburi</i>, (month of the) prospering of the
harvest; <i>tam-ti-ru-um</i>, month of rain; <i>tar-bi-tum</i> (month of the)
growth (of plants). <i>Pi-te-bâbi</i> means ‘opening of the gate’, and
probably refers to a religious ceremony.</p>

<p>The ancient Assyrian list of months is partly preserved
in the syllabar of months, and also occurs in the inscriptions
of the early Assyrian kings and in the so-called Cappadocian
tablets, which come from an Assyrian colony of the third
millenium at Kara Eyjuk in Asia Minor. We find:&mdash;2, perhaps
month of the moon-god; 3, <i>ku-zal-li</i>, shepherd’s month;
4, <i>al-la-na-a-ti</i>, also shepherd’s month; 6, <i>ša sa-ra-te</i>, perhaps
the name of some employment; 12, <i>qar-ra-a-tu</i>, name of an
occupation (?). The other names are missing or are uncertain.
In regard to the interpretation of the names from occupations a
certain caution should be exercised, since in accordance with
all the examples hitherto given a name like ‘shepherd’s month’
ought to refer not to the occupation as such but to the pasture
season. All other explanations are quite problematical.</p>

<p>In the above I have only been able to reproduce the
material collected by Assyriologists and the explanations given
by them: but from this it clearly appears that the development<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
of the series of months has proceeded in the same fashion here
as elsewhere. At the beginning we find an indefinite number
of names of months borrowed principally from natural phenomena.
Among these a selection takes place, the result of
which, however, is different in each city. At first it seems as
though series of 13 months arose. But these series, as the
examples from Lagash shew, were not fixed throughout.
New names penetrate into them, even the position of the month
can be altered. Finally the series becomes quite fixed, and
with this seems to be connected the falling away of the
thirteenth month: in the series of months now fixed at twelve
the leapmonth becomes a doubling of the preceding month.
While this development continues, the calendar takes on more
and more an ecclesiastical stamp, since months named from festivals
are constantly ousting those named from natural phenomena,
and finally attain to almost exclusive predominance.
This is easily to be understood in the case of ancient Sumer,
since not only were the priests alone&mdash;here as elsewhere&mdash;in
possession of the art of writing and the other higher
branches of knowledge of the people, but the temples also had
the largest landed property, with an extensive administration.
Occupations and religious ceremonies, festival seasons and
time-reckoning for practical purposes were more closely connected
at that time than at any other. The Semitic calendars
all present the same characteristics as the ancient Sumerian,
a resemblance which is only slightly disguised by the fact that
the signs of the now fixed Sumerian series of months are used
as ideograms of the months. Everyone read the ideograms in
accordance with his custom, so that a variety in the names of
months still existed, as the phonetic writings testify. But the
fixed writing naturally contributed to bring about fixed readings,
i. e. a fixed series of months.</p>


<h3 class="p2">2. THE ISRAELITES.</h3>

<p>The Israelites, like all Semitic races, reckoned in lunar
months. I need not discuss the views which ascribe to them a
solar year, or would make the old Canaanitish months divisions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
of the solar year. From early times the day of the new
moon was celebrated with general festivities and rest from
labour, and the old feasts of the agricultural year seem to
have been postponed till the time of full moon. Like the
Homeric Greeks, the Jews at their immigration had no names of
months. Hence they took over the old Canaanitish names.
The latter appear in the oldest portions of the law, in the regulations
for the feast of the Passover, which is to be celebrated
in <i>chodesh ha-abib</i>, the month of ears of corn, and in the
history of the building of Solomon’s temple<a id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a>, where three
others&mdash;<i>chodesh</i> or <i>yerash ziv</i>, <i>yerash bul</i>, <i>yerash ha-etanim</i>&mdash;are
mentioned and compared with the numerical months
by which their position is fixed. Of these <i>y. bul</i> and <i>y. etanim</i>
recur among the eleven Phoenician names of months known
from inscriptions. The above-mentioned series of months, which
we possess only in fragments, was therefore at least in part
identical with the Phoenician: hence the term ‘old Canaanitish’
is justified. The explanations are also clear, having regard to
the position of the months in the year. <i>Chodesh ha-abib</i>, corresponding
to the first month, about April, is the month of the
ripening ears. <i>Yerash ziv</i>, the second, about May, the month
of brightness (though certainly the etymology is not certain),
is referred to the splendour of the blossoming season, though
this falls earlier. But in May the dry season begins, and so
one would think rather of the splendour of the sun. <i>Yerash
ha-etanim</i>, corresponding to the seventh, about September,
means month of the flowing, i. e. of the perennial streams,
which now at the end of the dry season are the only ones
that have water. <i>Yerash bul</i>, the eighth, cannot be referred
to the gathering of the fruit (<i>bul</i>), which has already taken
place, but probably means the rainy month, since the autumn
rains now begin<a id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a>. The descriptions are therefore of the kind
already sufficiently familiar.</p>

<p>But in the writings of the Old Testament the numbering
of the months, beginning at the Feast of the Passover, is the
common method of description, which is only replaced by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
Babylonian names of months after the Captivity. It seems to
be fairly generally recognised that the numbering is later, and
according to what has already been shewn about the numbering
of months<a id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> this is always a phenomenon of an advanced
stage of civilisation. The inclination of the people towards
concrete descriptions of months must also have prepared the
way for the introduction of the Babylonian names. As to the
date of the introduction of the numbered months there is considerable
difference of opinion: at the time of Solomon<a id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a>, about
600 B. C.<a id="FNanchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a>, first demonstrable among the writers of the Captivity<a id="FNanchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a>.
For our purpose the chief point to note is that the
numbering is more recent than the naming of the months.
This question is again connected with that of the beginning of
the year, which will be dealt with below. For if the series of
numbered months begins in spring, yet there are also indications
of an earlier beginning in autumn<a id="FNanchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a>.</p>

<p>New evidence both for the beginning of the year in autumn
and for the months is found in an inscriptional calendar
from Gezer, dating from about the year 600<a id="FNanchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a>. It runs:&mdash;Two
months: bringing in of fruits; two months: sowing; two months:
late sowing; one month: pulling up of flax; one month: barley
harvest; one month: harvest of all other kinds of corn; two
months: vintage; one month: fruit-gathering. This agrees with
the course of the agricultural occupations, reckoning from about
September,&mdash;the bringing in of fruit is not the harvest but
the carrying home of the harvest from the fields&mdash;but is
naturally systematised so as to cover the months. Whoever
drew up this list knew neither fixed names nor a fixed enumeration
of the months: the question can only be whether this
state of affairs must have been general at the date 600 B. C. The
purpose of the list does not seem to me to have been clearly
recognised. It is obvious that such a list must have been
drawn up for practical ends. It helps to regulate the calendar.
From the agricultural work just engaged in the present month
is recognised: and then, with the aid of this calendar, it becomes
possible to calculate how many months will elapse before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
some other occupations begin. If this calendar came into
general use, names of months of the usual type would arise
from it.</p>

<p>It has been remarked above that the Israelites at their
immigration into Canaan had no names of months. Of course,
like all other primitive peoples, they occasionally reckoned a
few months up to or after this or that event, e. g. pregnancy.
This counting was a shifting one, i. e. it had no reference to
the solar year. That the practice of counting the months was
known is proved by the common word for month, <i>chodesh</i>,
literally ‘newness’, ‘new moon’, from <i>chadash</i>, ‘new’. The word
for moon is <i>yareach</i>. Among the Phoenicians <i>chodesh</i> means
only ‘new moon’: ‘month’ is <i>yerach</i>. In the Old Testament
this latter word also occurs several times: in the account of
the building of Solomon’s temple<a id="FNanchor_845" href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> (in three cases characteristically
combined with the old Canaanitish names), in Exodus<a id="FNanchor_846" href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a>,
in Deuteronomy and II Kings (in the expression <i>yerach yamim</i><a id="FNanchor_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a>),
and lastly, poetically, in Moses’ departing blessing<a id="FNanchor_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> and a few
times in Job and Zechariah.</p>

<p>When it is remembered that the months are counted not only
continuously but also by the appearance of each new moon<a id="FNanchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a>, it
becomes clear how the word <i>chodesh</i> has come to mean ‘month’,
and this is also a sure evidence for the practice of counting
the months, though not from a definite point of departure. The
latter process, i. e. the numbering of the months, is much later. The
earlier books of the Old Testament provide interesting material
for the significance of the word<a id="FNanchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a>. <i>Chodesh</i> means ‘new moon’,
‘feast of the new moon’ in the old narrative of Jonathan and
David<a id="FNanchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a>; in the combination ‘new moons and sabbaths’<a id="FNanchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a>; and
in the regulations of the Priestly Code about the burnt offering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
of the new moon<a id="FNanchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a>. From the new moon the days of the month
can be counted, and this is done in one case<a id="FNanchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a>. The number
of months is determined by counting the new moons: thus
certain passages can be understood (though not necessarily so),
e. g. in the Yahwist, Gen. XXXVIII, 24, “it came to pass about
three new moons (months) after”, and in Amos IV, 7, “when there
were yet three new moons (months) to the harvest”. Here
‘new moon’ and ‘month’ are essentially identical: in this manner
a change of sense has come about. Another point is
whether at the time in question the word in this connexion
had the sense of new moon or of month: I should be inclined
to regard the latter supposition as correct. In the regulations
for the Passover Feast also the sense is not to be determined
definitely<a id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a>. If prominence is given to the idea of duration
of time, the sense ‘month’ clearly appears, e. g. in the story
of Jephthah’s daughter:<a id="FNanchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a> “Let me alone two months, that I may
depart and go down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity.”
Thus the word in earlier and later times is often used
in the counting of the months<a id="FNanchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a>. The sense ‘month’ can be
rendered clear by the addition <i>yamim</i><a id="FNanchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a>, which is an older
idiom, for neither with <i>chodesh</i> nor with <i>shana</i>, ‘year’, is
<i>yamim</i> originally an empty addition. <i>Shana</i> perhaps means
‘change’, ‘recurrence’, i. e. of the seasons. If the word is
used in a calendarial sense, <i>yamim</i> is a practical explanation.
The result is that <i>chodesh</i> stands for ‘month’, even where the
idea of the new moon is completely excluded, e. g., with
numbers of days added, as early as in the Yahwistic part of
the old History of the Kings, II Sam. XXIV, 8, ‘nine months
and twenty days’, or in the history of Solomon, I Kings V,
14: “And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at
home”. The older senses belong in general to the older
writings; it is however to be presumed that before the beginning
of the literary period the change of sense had already
advanced rather far.</p>

<p>In by far the greatest number of cases <i>chodesh</i> stands
in combination with an ordinal numeral, not in Deuteronomy,
but in Jeremiah and the writers of the Exile, in the last Reviser
of the Pentateuch, in the Priestly Code. Hence it follows
that these numbered months are a late innovation, and they
will be spoken of again in connexion with the matter of the
beginning of the year<a id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a>.</p>


<h3 class="p2">3. THE PRE-MOHAMMEDAN ARABIANS.</h3>

<p>The series of months now used by the Arabs is the ancient
Meccan series, which, on account of the importance of
Mecca as a centre of trade, had acquired a more than local
extension and was adopted by Islam. Besides this series
others are handed down, partly by Arabian writers, and partly
in the Sabean inscriptions: the latter I pass over, since there
is no translation of them, so that they are of no use for my
purpose<a id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a>. The Meccan series is:&mdash;1, <i>safar I</i>, now called
<i>muharram</i>, ‘the holy’, a re-naming which, according to an
Arabic author, Buchari, first took place under Islam; 2, <i>safar II</i>;
3, <i>rabi I</i>; 4, <i>rabi II</i>; 5, <i>jumada I</i>; 6, <i>jumada II</i>; 7, <i>rajab</i>;
8, <i>sha’ban</i>; 9, <i>ramadan</i>; 10, <i>shawwal</i>; 11, <i>dhu-l-qa’da</i>; 12, <i>dhu-l-hijja</i>.
These names, in so far as they are explainable, refer
to seasons and festivals. This is best seen from the three
pairs of months which form the first half-year. I quote Wellhausen:<a id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a>&mdash;“For
the season Çafar the Lisan 6, 134 gives
abundant examples; it gives a name to plants which grow at
that time, animals which are born then, and rains which fall
in it. It falls in the autumn. Gumâda often occurs in the
old poetry and always refers to the worst winter-cold, the
dear time in which the poor must be fed by the rich. Especially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
favoured is the description of the evil night in Gumâda,
when the dogs do not bark, the snakes, which are otherwise
out at night-time, remain in their holes, and the traveller
eagerly looks out for a friendly fire. The Rabî’ falls, according
to the calendar, between Çafar and Gumâda, and therefore
in late autumn. But commonly the Rabî’ is the season
when, after the autumn and winter rains, the steppe becomes
green and the tribes disperse to the pastures, where the camels
bring forth their young and the rich milking-season
approaches.... The camels are pregnant ‘in the tenth month’,
and bring forth their young in February.” This statement is
supported by the etymology. <i>Safar</i> comes from a root with
the meaning ‘to be empty’. Since two months appear between
<i>safar</i> and the cold season, the two months of <i>safar</i> include
the end of the dry and the beginning of the rainy season, before
a more abundant vegetation has sprung up, and are therefore
the worst period of lack of food. The root from which
<i>jumada</i> comes has the sense ‘to grow stiff’, which suits the
time of the sharp cold. <i>Rabi</i> as a season has a double sense,
it is partly used to describe a period in autumn which is often
identified with <i>charif</i>, the date-harvest, and partly to describe
the pasture-season in spring. The explanation of this fact is
doubtless that the word refers to the sprouting vegetation, the
pasture-season, partly, indeed, to the vegetation which appears
simultaneously with the autumn rains, but partly to the richer
pasture which springs up with the increasing heat after the
winter rains. Out of these three seasons, according to a familiar
precedent, six months are made. They do not exactly
cover the winter half of the year, but fall somewhat earlier,
since the last month, <i>jumada II</i>, belongs to the cold period.
As for the other months, the sense of <i>ramadan</i>, ‘the hot’, is
certain, and it alludes to the warm season, in fact to its beginning,
since <i>ramadan</i> is the third month after <i>jumada II</i>.
The attempted explanations of <i>sha’ban</i> and <i>shawwal</i> are all
very uncertain. The other three names refer to festivals. In
<i>rajab</i> a festival was celebrated in all holy places, in which
sacrifices of camels and sheep were offered up. The root means
‘to fear, to reverence’; the month is therefore called the ‘holy’,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
or the ‘deaf and dumb’, since the noise of weapons is stilled.
The names of the last two months refer to the great pilgrimage
to Mecca. <i>Dhu-l-qa’da</i> is ‘the month of sitting’, and the
explanation given for the name&mdash;that the month was so
called because in it no expeditions or predatory excursions
took place&mdash;is doubtless correct. It is the first month of the
holy peace which prevails during the time of pilgrimage. The
second month is named from the feast of pilgrims itself,
<i>dhu-l-hijja</i>.</p>

<span class="fs70">CALENDAR REGULATION. 1. THE INTERCALATION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy1">The circumstance that the lunar months are among almost
all peoples named from the phases of Nature involves the
necessity of an agreement between the two really incommensurable
periods given by the sun and the moon. This problem
is the central point of the older scientific chronology. We
shall now investigate more closely how the problem has arisen,
and what has been its development among the primitive
peoples.</p>

<p>Where there is only a series of less than twelve months,
the problem of calendar regulation does not exist. The series
is begun on the appearance of the signs from which the first
month is named, and is continued from that point until the end.
The vacant period serves, unconsciously of course, to bring
lunar reckoning and solar year into agreement. Nevertheless
the months can be fixed in a more accurate fashion. The Eskimos
of Greenland, for instance, mark the winter solstice by
the position of the sun, and then begin to count the moons,
and continue doing so until the moon can no longer be observed
in the bright summer nights<a id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a>. The Lower Thompson Indians
in British Columbia counted up to ten or sometimes
eleven months, the remainder of the year being called the
autumn or late fall. This indefinite period of unnamed months
enabled them to bring the lunar and solar year into harmony.
Also the Shuswap and the Lillooet in the same country counted
eleven months and then the ‘fall-time’, which was the balance
of the year<a id="FNanchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a>.</p>

<p>Among most peoples, however, a series of months covering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
the whole year has arisen, and this series has more
often 13 than 12 months. Here the difficulties first begin. If
a new moon falls on a certain day of the solar year, in the
following year a new moon will occur about 11 days before
or 19 days after this day, and in the year after that about 21
days before or 9 days after it. Since the natural phases are
bound up with the solar year, they get out of place in relation
to the moon. The situation is still further complicated by
the fact that the phases of Nature, and with them the occupations,
vary somewhat according to the peculiarities of the climate
in different years. Hence doubt arises, and the accustomed
order of succession of the months is broken. And this
is not a mere theoretical piece of reasoning: primitive peoples
are not seldom in perplexity as to which month they are to
count. Of the Dakota it is said that they often have heated
debates as to which moon it is. The raccoons do not come
out of their winter holes at the same time every winter, the
conditions which cause inflammation of the eyes do not appear
at the same time every spring, the geese lay their eggs at a
slightly different period according to the character of the year.
Twelve moons do not bring them back to the same point in
the season as that from which their reckoning began; and
therefore towards the end of the winter there is dispute among
the Dakota as to the correct current date<a id="FNanchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a>. If the people has
a thirteenth month, the matter is no better. Of the Pawnee,
who had an intercalary month, it is stated that they sometimes
became inextricably involved in reckoning, and were obliged
to have recourse to objects about them to rectify their computations.
Councils have been known to be disturbed, or even
broken up, in consequence of irreconcilable differences of opinion
as to the correctness of their calculation<a id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a>. The same
is reported of the Caffres. Their months are named e. g.
from the first cry of the cuckoo, the flowering of the erythusia,
the dust in the dry season, midwinter, and since all these phenomena
may appear at somewhat different dates, even the Caffre
astrologers do not know what moon they are really in. The first
appearance of the Pleiades just before sunrise always rectifies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
the confusion<a id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a>. Even peoples who have a developed, astronomically
regulated, lunisolar calendar sometimes have recourse
to the natural phases in order to rectify it. In Bali not only
were the stars observed but also the flowering of certain plants,
or even the date when the white ants got their wings, in order
to rectify the lunar calendar<a id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a>. The months of the Bataks of
Sumatra are regulated by the constellation Scorpio<a id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a>: the magicians,
who control the calendar, are not certain as to the
position of the months, but look for general points of reference
in the phenomena of Nature. Thus, for instance, the dates
of certain migratory birds are known: they come in the fourth
and go in the first month. In the third month a black flying-ant
is accustomed to appear in great numbers. The presence
of the bird of prey <i>lali piuan</i> makes known the sixth and seventh
months. The bird <i>sosoit</i> sings in the eleventh month,
and the turtle-dove is silent in the eighth. The west monsoon
proclaims the third, storms are very frequent in the eleventh
and twelfth<a id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a>.</p>

<p>Many peoples slip over the difficulties, they do not properly
know of how many moons the year consists: such peoples are
the Dyaks<a id="FNanchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a>, the Warumbi of Central Africa<a id="FNanchor_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a>, the Ibo-speaking
peoples<a id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a>, the Algonquin<a id="FNanchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a>. But if a definite series of months
is established, without a vacant interval such as occurs in
the case of some peoples, the number of months naturally
becomes 12 or 13. Even in this case the people sometimes
let matters go as they will, as is reported of the Yukaghir.
The people having been christianised, says our authority, it is
now difficult to say whether the ancient Yukaghir made some
adjustment by adding a month <ins class="corr" id="tn-242" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'to accomodate their'">
to accommodate their</ins> lunar year
to the solar one. It seems to me, from the answers which I
received from the Yukaghir to my inquiries, that this point did
not interest them. Generally a month is the time from one
new moon to another, but it did not matter to them whether
twelve such months made up a full cycle of the year or not.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
When it was necessary they simply ignored some of the names
of months, being far ahead<a id="FNanchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a>. The Koryak have twelve lunar
months, and the first one begins at the time of the winter solstice
and corresponds to our December. Yet they are very
little troubled by the fact that in the interval between two
winter solstices an extra new moon may occur<a id="FNanchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a>. The very
perplexity described above implies a great advance, viz. the
recognition of the difficulties, which is the first stage towards
mastering them.</p>

<p>Therefore every now and again some month must be left
out or a month added. This necessity, at first not recognised,
or not clearly so, is the chief cause of the above-mentioned
disagreement in the reckoning of the months<a id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a>. For when the
counting is performed in accordance with the series only, it
soon happens (apart from the climatic variations of the
years already mentioned) that the months deviate from the
natural phases from which they are named. The arguments
in the dispute as to which month it really is are based on the
condition of the phases of nature: the result is a correction
of the counting, i. e. the months are pushed forwards or backwards
according to circumstances, i. e. the month which should
have followed is left out, or a month is added to the series.
Thus an intercalation comes about without it being suspected
what is really done. In general the whole process is not even
so conscious as the desire for theoretical exactness has led
me to represent in using the example of the Dakota. The
series and the number of months were from the beginning unstable,
and the natural conditions have brought it about that
this characteristic has been preserved in at least one particular,
viz. that in certain cases a month could be passed over.
Let us, for the sake of clearness, take a fictitious example
from Swedish conditions. As a rule the rye-harvest falls at
the beginning of August, the oat-harvest at the end of August
and beginning of September, the potato-harvest at the end of
September. These occupations might very well be distributed
among three months named after them. But a year would sometimes
come in which the oat-harvest took place about at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
interval between two moons, the rye-harvest at the beginning
of the first moon, and the potato-harvest at the end of
the second moon. There would therefore be no place for
a month of the oat-harvest, it must simply be omitted. That
this is the case among the primitive peoples is proved by the
fact that many, in fact most, of them have a series of thirteen
months of which one must according to circumstances be
passed over in certain years.</p>

<p>Experience teaches the peoples who have only a twelve-month
series that this is not sufficient: so we are told of the
Mandan and Minnetaree that they have generally recognised
that the year has more than twelve months<a id="FNanchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a>. When the intercalary
month, as among certain Indians, is named ‘the lost
month’<a id="FNanchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a>, this points to the fact that it is an addition to a
twelve-month series, just as in Babylonia, where the same
method of expression recurs<a id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a>. The Masai have twelve months<a id="FNanchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a>.
The great rains cease with <i>loo-’n-gokwa</i>, which is named from
the evening setting of the Pleiades. Should the rains still
continue at the beginning of the following month, the Masai
say:&mdash;“We have forgotten, this is <i>loo-’n-gokwa</i>.” Should the
hot season not be over at the beginning of the month following
<i>ol-oiborare</i>, they say:&mdash;“We have forgotten, this is
<i>ol-oiborare</i>”<a id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a>. It is clear that if through the dead reckoning
the months are advanced in relation to the seasons, one month
will be repeated, i. e. intercalated. The preceding month is
forgotten.</p>

<p>Thus the necessity for modifying the series of months is
felt, and in response to this an empirical intercalation arises.
When this intercalation is left to itself, conflicting opinions, as
we have already seen, arise as to it. An end is made to
these disputes and order is established when the decision is
placed in the hands of definite persons. This was done among
the Jews, the regulation of whose calendar affords a particularly
plain example of this empirical intercalation, which, out of
religious conservatism, they kept until well into the post-Christian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
period, in fact until the necessities of the Dispersion compelled,
from the second century, a mitigation of the original rules, and
finally at an uncertain period, perhaps not until medieval times,
led to a calculated regulation. According to the Talmud the
appearance of the crescent of the new moon was determined
by deposition before a court of justice of three members. After
that the beginning of the month was signalised in the country
in earlier times by fires, later by couriers. A suitable intercalation
was absolutely necessary for the celebration of the
feasts, since at the Feast of the Passover on the 14th of
Nisan the first-fruits of the corn were offered, and the two
other great feasts were also of an agrarian character. For
this purpose the court of justice visited the fields. If they
saw that the crops were not yet ripe at the Passover time,
and that the fruits also were not so far advanced as they
were accustomed to be at this time of the year, they intercalated
a month in accordance with these two signs: if only
one of these signs was to be observed the decision was made
to depend on other minor circumstances<a id="FNanchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a>. By way of example
I give an official document of Rabbi Gamaliel II, issued to the
inhabitants of Judaea, Galilaea, and the Dispersion at the date
90&ndash;110 A. D.<a id="FNanchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a>. “We make known to you that the lambs are
small and the young of the birds are tender and the time of
the corn-harvest has not yet come, so that it seems right to
me and my brothers to add to this year thirty days.” The
intercalary month was the last month of the year, <i>Adar</i>. On
rare occasions <i>Nisan</i>, when it had begun, was altered into
<i>Adar II</i>. Here the intercalation took place in the interests
of the religious cult, but the cult on its side was dependent
on the natural phenomena. The intercalation is of the same
empirical order as that which we have met among the primitive
peoples. It is only that the development of the ecclesiastical
laws has led to a judicial procedure, and the task of
determining the intercalation has been handed over to a committee
of the Sanhedrin.</p>

<p>There exists a possibility of a somewhat different development<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
among peoples who originally had less than twelve
months and also counted a vacant interval: it is conceivable
that the unnamed months may be named, until at last twelve
months have names and the vacant interval remains only as
an intercalary month. This seems to be the case among
the Central Eskimos; they have a ‘sunless’ month, which
covers the time when the sun does not appear and when
there is also hardly any twilight: it is said to be of indeterminate
length. After an interval of a few years this month
is left out, if new moon and winter solstice coincide<a id="FNanchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a>. When
the intercalary month has thus arisen, its position in the year
is fixed. One other example of this method may exist. The
author who gives the list of the months of the Kwakiutl of the
Island of Vancouver, beginning with March, inserts between
the tenth and eleventh months the winter solstice, and says
that the solstice moons are called by a name which probably
means ‘split both ways’, and adds that the readjustment is
made in midwinter<a id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a>. Unfortunately the author does not tell us
how the readjustment is made, whether the winter solstice
moon or some other moon is the intercalary month. If the
former be the case, the explanation is given by the above.</p>

<p>There is rarely any rule for the position of the intercalary
month. Where the sources simply enumerate a thirteen-month
series, it is to be presumed that no fixed position for
the intercalary month exists. But such a month can be found,
since naturally a month named from a natural phase of less
importance will be omitted, or an additional month inserted, at
a time when there is little work going on, and when consequently
little attention is paid to the time-reckoning. So it is
said of the Pawnee that the intercalary month was usually
put in after the summer months<a id="FNanchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a>. On the Society Islands
the month corresponding to our March or our July was commonly
omitted<a id="FNanchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a>.</p>

<p>The first regulation of the calendar is therefore roughly
empirical, and in fact is nothing but an occasional and arbitrary
deviation, necessitated by the natural phases, from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
existing series of months. The natural phases, however, as
we saw in chapter IV, are determined in more accurate fashion
by the stars, and particularly by their risings and settings.
Consequently the months also can be named from stars, and
a considerable number of such names of months was found
in the lists of chapter VII. This phenomenon has hitherto been
only briefly touched upon; for the regulation of the calendar
it is of supreme importance, since the risings and settings of
the stars accurately determine the date, so that the fluctuation
of the natural phases is excluded. Where only one month is
named after a star and determined by it, the series of months
is immovably fixed.</p>

<p>Just as the Pleiades play the most important part in the
determination of time from the phases of Nature, so it is also
in the naming of the months. The Konyag have a month
named from this constellation, which is followed by one
named after Orion<a id="FNanchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a>. Of the Diegueño of S. California it is
stated that they divided the year into six months and observed
the morning rising of five chief stars. The names of
months are given, but unfortunately there is no information
as to the sense<a id="FNanchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a>. The Hottentots and the Herero both have
a Pleiades month<a id="FNanchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a>. On the islands of the Pacific Ocean the
practice is carried so far that in some cases every month is
described by the rising of a constellation, as is done by the
Maoris<a id="FNanchor_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a>, or even named from stars, as among the inhabitants
of Mortlock’s Island<a id="FNanchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> and, for most of the months, by tribes
of the Torres Straits<a id="FNanchor_893" href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a>.</p>

<p>This, however, is an exception. Where only one month
is named from the rising of a star or brought into connexion
with it&mdash;in this case the stars in question are usually the
Pleiades&mdash;the latter furnishes the means of correcting the
reckoning of the months, and the intercalary month is consequently
introduced, as need arises, before the month in
question. The Pleiades month therefore of itself becomes the
starting-point of the reckoning of the months, i. e. becomes
the beginning of the year. Immediately after the discovery of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
America it was already reported of certain tribes on the
Mexican coast that they began the year at the setting of the
Pleiades and divided it into moon-months<a id="FNanchor_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a>. In Loango the
months are counted from new moons, but Sirius, the rainy
star, offers a means of correcting the reckoning sidereally.
With the first new moon which sees Sirius rising in the east
their new cycle of twelve months begins, and this must run
as well as it can until the new year. When the cycle of
months and the year do not fit, which happens about every
three years, a thirteenth month must be inserted. This is the
evil time, when the wandering spirits are at their worst<a id="FNanchor_895" href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a>.
The Caffres have twelve moon-months with the usual descriptive
names: on this account uncertainty often arises as to
which month it really is. The confusion is always rectified
by the morning rising of the Pleiades, and the reckoning goes
on smoothly for a time, until the months once more get out
of place and it becomes necessary to refer again to the stars
in order to correct them<a id="FNanchor_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a>. In Bali the Pleiades and Orion
are observed for the purpose of correcting the calendar of
moons by intercalation: thus the month <i>kartika</i> is doubled, or
the month <i>asada</i> is prolonged until the Pleiades appear at
sunset. Moreover certain natural phenomena are observed<a id="FNanchor_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a>.
In New Zealand, where all months were described by stars,
the year began with the new moon following on the rising of
the winter star <i>puanga</i> (Rigel)<a id="FNanchor_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a>; the thirteenth month often
passed unobserved<a id="FNanchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a>, i. e. served as an intercalary month.
Elsewhere we are told that the displacement of the moon-months
in relation to the year was rectified through the observation
of the rising of the Pleiades and of Orion, and that the
most accurate way of calculating the beginning of the year
was to observe the first new moon after the morning rising
of Rigel<a id="FNanchor_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a>. The Papuans limit the year by the constellation of
the Serpent, <i>manggouanija</i>; when it appears again in the
north, it is a sign that the new year is beginning<a id="FNanchor_901" href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a>. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
people of Nauru, west of the Gilbert Islands, count by moon-months.
The time that elapses until the Great Bear returns
to the same spot is reckoned as a year<a id="FNanchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a>. The last two reports
are so condensed that it is impossible to see whether
the stars serve for the rectifying of the calendar of moons
found among these peoples, or only for the fixing of the beginning
of the year, which, as will be shewn below, may be
independent of the reckoning of months.</p>

<p>About the regulation of the Hawaiian calendar the authorities
are not unanimous. Dibble says (p. 108) that the month
<i>welehu</i> completed the year, and the new year began with the
following month, <i>makalii</i>. The year varied between 12 and 13
months. Each month had 30 days; however he adds that in
practice the number of days varied between 30 and 29. This
is the phenomenon familiar in other places, e. g. in Greece,
among the Bataks, etc., in which a round number of 30 days
is given to the moon-month, the real length of this being a little
more than 29½ days. Fornander (I, 119 ff.) states that this
variation, though not common, did occur, but asserts that the
year of 360 days was rectified by the intercalation of 5 days at
the end of the month <i>welehu</i>: these were <i>tabu</i> days, dedicated
to the festival of the god Lono. Similarly an old woman of
Maui stated that eight months had 30 days and four 31, and
that these additional days were called <i>na mahoe</i>, ‘the twins’<a id="FNanchor_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a>.
This statement cannot be correct, since the month was strictly
lunar and must have been wholly disarranged by these intercalary
days, as is pointed out by the historian of the Sandwich
Islands, W. D. Alexander<a id="FNanchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a>. This writer also remarks that
it is a well-established fact that the ancient Hawaiians intercalated
a month about every third year, but that the rule
governing the intercalation is unknown. Certainly there was
no such rule, but the intercalation was empirically treated, and
regulated by the appearance of the Pleiades. Such contradictory
statements as the above are due to the influence of the
European calendar, owing to which the native calendar has
early fallen into disuse. Fornander has probably mistaken a
feast for intercalary days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span></p>

<p>The treatment of the calendar among the Bataks of Sumatra
is of great interest. The calendar indeed originates in
India: the days of the months shew the familiar names of
planets in corrupted Sanskrit forms, four times repeated and
distinguished by various additions. Only the 28th and 29th or
the 29th and 30th days, as the case may be, have names of
another kind, so as to equalise the number of the days of the
moon-month. The week is therefore not shifting but is immovably
fitted into the month. The months are regulated by
Scorpio, the largest star of which is Antares. The year begins
with the new moon at the morning setting of Orion and
the contemporary morning rising of Scorpio in May. The full
moon fourteen days later then stands in the constellation Scorpio.
In the first half of the year the full moon goes farther
from Scorpio every month, and in the second half gets nearer
and nearer to it. In the Batak calendar, which has 12, sometimes
13, × 30 squares, the sign of Scorpio is registered at
the proper day, and the month is decided by it. As a means
of control the soothsayer uses a buffalo rib with 12 × 30 holes
(four times repeated), and every day he draws a string through
one hole in order to keep account of the days. It is clear
that the calendar can give no certain help in the establishing
of the month, and that the means of control must be directly
misleading, since the moon-months vary between 29 and 30
days. For this reason the soothsayer is often uncertain in his
reckoning of the months, and refers to the natural phases in
order to correct it<a id="FNanchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a>. Hence in his selection of days he looks
not only to the current month, but also to the preceding. Our
authority says that the surplus month is no intercalary month
in the European sense, although it is likely that to it originally
fell the task of equalising the lunar and the solar years.
This is indeed the only correct explanation. When, presumably
in the twelfth month, a following month is involved in the decision,
the thirteenth is also included so that an intercalation
takes place. If the thirteenth month is not available, the first
is taken, we are told. But an intercalation is necessary all the
same: the observation of the natural phases and of the morning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
rising of Orion serves for the correction. And this can happen
just because the people are uncertain in the reckoning, and act
according to circumstances. The Batak calendar is a product
of decay, and is used exclusively for divination, not as a genuine
calendar<a id="FNanchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a>; but it is of great interest to observe how the
soothsayers, since they do not possess the knowledge necessary
for a proper management of the calendar, fall back upon
primitive methods. It is significant that the indispensable thirteenth
month has often been lost: the people do not even
understand the difference between the months and the year,
and yet they cannot avoid the necessity of the intercalation.</p>

<p>There are two historically important cases of this empirically
regulated intercalation of months, which must be dealt
with in detail, since they are much debated. The dispute has
arisen from a failure to recognise the empirical intercalation
and its workings. The one case is that of the old Arabian
calendar before Mohammed, the other that of the Babylonian
calendar.</p>

<p>The old Arabian names of months depend in great measure,
as has been shewn already<a id="FNanchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a>, upon the seasons. Originally
therefore the months must have been connected with the
solar year, and must have been approximately fixed in their
position by the sufficiently familiar empirical method. The same
thing is shewn by the naming of the last months from the pilgrimage
to Mecca. In pre-Mohammedan times the pilgrimages
were at the same time business journeys; trade and cult were,
as so often, united, and commercial intercourse was first made
really possible when by religious sanction a time of peace was
established during which journeys to and fro could be taken
in safety. The first month of the peace of God is <i>dhu-l-qa’da</i>,
and <i>dhu-l-hijja</i> is the month of the gathering in Mecca: the
following month, <i>safar I</i>, was also included in the time of
peace, and was therefore called <i>muharram</i>. During all three
months there were fairs: in the neighbourhood of Mecca there
was a whole succession of them, following upon each other in
<i>dhu-l-qa’da</i> and <i>dhu-l-hijja</i>; in <i>safar</i> there was a corn-market in
Yemen<a id="FNanchor_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a>. The gay life of the great fair of Mecca is described<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
in detail in old Arabic sources; it seems to have drawn the people
almost more than the religious ceremonies, and first gave
Mecca its real importance. An annual fair is however dependent
upon the seasons, both on account of the journeys and for
the products bought and sold. Sprenger has already remarked
that the winter months are quite unsuitable for merchants’
journeys to Syria, and that in the late summer it was not to be
expected that corn which had been cut at the beginning of
March should be taken in to the markets<a id="FNanchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a>. Because of the
markets that were held in them, the months must also have
had a fixed position in the solar year. This importance of
Mecca explains why the Meccan months became so wide-spread.
The two names <i>dhu-l-qa’da</i> and <i>dhu-l-hijja</i> are formed
with <i>dhu</i>, differently from the others, and were coined at Mecca.
This leads to the conclusion that these names were innovations
occasioned by the business intercourse of that city.</p>

<p>For the purpose of determining the time of the peace
of God and of the gathering in Mecca unity must prevail
as to the position of the months, and for this the above-mentioned
occasional correction of the position is quite inadequate.
Mohammed prescribed the strictly lunar year: by this means
the time of every month was definitely fixed, but in about
33 years the months would pass through the circle of a
whole solar year. The question is whether before Mohammed
an ordered intercalation, which he abolished, or the lunar year
existed. For although it lies in the nature of things that the
market should originally be connected with a definite time of
the year, it cannot of course be denied that later, when the
fairs had already attained this predominating position, the date
could be fixed by reference to the purely lunar year. It is certain
that in the years just before the prescription of the lunar year
by Mohammed the months were inverted in relation to the
year, so that the spring months fell in autumn and the autumn
months came in the spring<a id="FNanchor_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a>.</p>

<p>The passage in the Koran 9, 36 ff. is often adduced as
evidence that Mohammed abolished the intercalation:&mdash;“Truly
the number of the months with God is twelve months in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
book of God, on the day when He created the heavens and
the earth. Of these four (i. e. <i>rajab</i>, <i>dhu-l-qa’da</i>, <i>dhu-l-hijja</i>, <i>muharram</i>)
are holy. This is the right religion. Be not unjust
therein towards yourselves, but fight against the heathen without
distinction, since they make no distinction in fighting
against you, and know that God is on the side of the faithful.
The <i>nasî</i> is in truth an addition to unbelief (or, in unbelief),
in which the unbelievers go astray. They allow it one
year, and one year they explain it as unlawful, in order to equalise
(bring into agreement) the number of that (i. e. the months)
which God has commanded to keep holy. But they declare
lawful what God has forbidden.” It is claimed that the emphasis
laid upon the fact that there are twelve months is directed
against the intercalation, but this is no proof. The sense depends
entirely upon what is implied by <i>nasî</i>. Etymologically
the word is derived from <i>nasaa</i>, ‘to push aside, away’.</p>

<p>On this point there has been from the earliest days of
Arabic literature a dispute which has been still further complicated
by modern hypotheses<a id="FNanchor_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a>. According to one view <i>nasî</i>
is the intercalation of a month, which served to bring the
months into agreement with the solar year<a id="FNanchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a>. Some authors
have even attempted to establish an intercalary cycle, and it
has been asserted that the intercalation was borrowed from
the Jews. This opinion may be left out of account, since the
cycles differ among themselves and are therefore invented,
while the intercalation was governed by a hereditary <i>nasî</i>-controller
from the tribe of Kinâna, who was called the <i>qalammas</i>,
i. e. ‘Sea of Wisdom’. If the intercalation is controlled
by a central authority, as e. g. in Babylonia, an intercalary
cycle is unnecessary: the central authority supplies its place.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
According to the other view the <i>nasî</i> consists in the transferring
of the holy character of one month to another, e. g. the
declaring of <i>muharram</i> as free and the pronouncing of <i>safar</i>
as holy instead of it. This view is based on the supposition
that the Arabs found a time of peace lasting for three successive
months burdensome, and in order to be able to make
predatory excursions in a holy month, and yet keep the number
of holy months unchanged, they made another month holy
instead. The treatment e. g. of the <i>karneios</i> by the Argives
and of the <i>daisios</i> by Alexander the Great<a id="FNanchor_913" href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> was very similar.
Therefore, it is maintained, before Mohammed the year was
a purely lunar one, and Mohammed only forbade the disarrangement
of the holy period. These authorities also ascribe
the right of changing the holy month to the <i>qalammas</i>, who
at the end of the feast of pilgrims in <i>dhu-l-hijja</i> rose and in
an address to the assembly arranged the re-distribution. A
third view, according to which the feast of pilgrims was held
eleven days later every year, until after a cycle of 33 years
it came back again to the same month, is certainly incorrect,
since the feast was connected with the phases of the
moon. The theory is extracted from the comparison between
the lunar and the solar years<a id="FNanchor_914" href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a>.</p>

<p>Several sources give the words in which the <i>qalammas</i>
made known the re-distribution: they are affected by later
views but must contain a kernel of truth, since they shew
difficulties which are not even noticed by the authorities.
According to Kalby the expression runs simply:&mdash;“The <i>safar</i>
of this year is declared holy”, or “free”; according to Ibn
Ishaq:&mdash;“O God, I declare one of the two months called
<i>safar</i>, namely the first, to be free, and I postpone the other
till next year.” What is meant by postponing <i>safar II</i> until
the next year is unexplained and unexplainable. Since the
year begins with <i>safar I</i>, and the proclamation takes place
in <i>dhu-l-hijja</i>, <i>safar II</i> already belongs to the next year. <i>Safar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
II</i> is in itself not holy, so that here there can be no question
of a changing of the holy character of the month. But if by
the expression <i>safar safar I</i> is understood, matters become
clear. <i>Safar I</i> is doubled: <i>I a</i> is an intercalary month, and
therefore not holy, and belongs as a thirteenth month to the
current year; <i>I b</i> begins the new year and is holy. “I remove
<i>safar</i> (viz. <i>I b</i>) to next year” is an incorrect but intelligible way
of saying that the new year begins with this month. In the
<i>Qâmûs</i> the expressions runs:&mdash;“O God, I am authorised to
move the months or to leave them in their places and confirm
them, and none can blame me or put me to my defence.
O God, I declare the first <i>safar</i> to be free, and the
second holy. The same do I determine in respect of the two
<i>rajab</i>, namely <i>rajab</i> and <i>sha’ban</i>.” The first sentence, if
authentic, doubtless refers to an intercalation, since the words
are ‘move the months’, and not ‘the holy character of the
months’; but we can hardly insist so far upon the expression.
The last sentence is more conclusive. It shews, namely, that
not only was <i>safar I</i> shifted to <i>safar II</i>, but at the same
time <i>rajab</i> was moved to <i>sha’ban</i>. This is a system, not an
incidental expedient to render possible a military expedition
in a holy month. Later authorities add that the holy character
of <i>safar</i> was moved to <i>rabi I</i>, and that the process went
on from month to month until every month in the year had
at one time or another been declared holy. How this is to
be understood is shewn by the oldest report which has been
handed down to us. It comes from Modjahid, who was born
in the year 21 of the Hegira. “The heathen were accustomed
in every month of the lunar year to go on pilgrimages for
only two years.” It must be realised that in the course of a
cycle of 33 years a month of the lunar year will coincide two
to three times, according to the series, with one and the same
month of the lunisolar year, and that the months of the Mohammedan
lunar year and of the old Arabian lunisolar year,
which must once have existed, have the same names. Modjahid’s
statement can only be understood thus: that the heathen
pilgrimage was re-arranged every third year in relation to the
Mohammedan lunar months&mdash;two years is a rough approximation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
for ‘sometimes two, sometimes three years’&mdash;because
it was to be kept in place in regard to the solar year. But
the pilgrimage took place in a definite month, and therefore
the months also belonged to a lunisolar year. If the months
of the lunisolar year are compared with those of the lunar
year confusion results, since both series have the same names.
Let us take, for example, a sentence of the distinguished
chronologist Albiruni, who represents the opinion that <i>nasî</i>
means the intercalation of a month: “The first intercalation
applied to <i>muharram</i>, in consequence <i>safar</i> was called <i>muharram</i>,
<i>rabi I</i> was called <i>safar</i>, and so on; and in this
way all the names of all the months were changed. The second
intercalation applied to <i>safar</i>; in consequence the next following
month (<i>rabi I</i>, the original <i>rabi II</i>)<a id="FNanchor_915" href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a> was called <i>safar</i>, and this
went on till the intercalation had passed through all twelve months
and returned to <i>muharram</i>.” When other writers, not so well
trained in chronology, say that the hallowing of the month
was transferred from <i>muharram</i> to <i>safar</i> and from <i>safar</i> to
<i>rabi I</i>, this means that, according to the year, the <i>safar</i> or
<i>rabi I</i> of the lunar year corresponds to the <i>muharram</i> of
the lunisolar year. When in the speech of the <i>qalammas</i>,
<i>safar I</i> and <i>rajab</i> are simultaneously shifted to the month
following in each case, this involves the shifting of the whole
series of months. A genuine intercalation therefore takes
place. The term <i>nasî</i>, ‘to push aside’, resembles the world-wide
description of the intercalation of the month. <i>Safar I</i>
is ‘forgotten’, but upon this it follows that not this month is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
holy, but the following one, which is now also called <i>safar I</i>
but corresponds to <i>safar II</i> of the strictly lunar year. The
sanctity or non-sanctity of the months was for the people the
all-important point, and the <i>qalammas</i>, who was a religious
authority, was obliged to refer to it. Hence he declared the
month as free and the following month as holy without expressing
himself, as we should have wished, in the technical
terms of chronology. The people understood him: if the month
after <i>dhu-l-hijja</i> was free, it followed that not this month but
the next was holy, the month with which the new year began,
<i>safar I</i>. The intercalation therefore involves a transference
of the sanctity of the month following the feast of pilgrims to
the next but one after the feast. Hence has arisen the misunderstanding
that the <i>nasî</i> consisted <i>only</i> in a transference of
the sanctity of the months.</p>

<p>The tribe of Kinana, to which the <i>qalammas</i> belonged,
inhabited the district around Mecca, and the famous tribe of
the Koraish, its most distinguished branch, was supreme in
Mecca<a id="FNanchor_916" href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a>. The calendar regulation therefore took place in the
interests of Mecca and its trade, and it is quite ridiculous to
say that the sanctity of a month was transferred to another
merely in order to render possible a predatory excursion.
Besides this would make matters no better, since all the tribes
concerned would have to have peace or war in the same
months. A shifting of this nature would only be really effectual
if it offered a means of surprising an unsuspecting neighbour
in time of peace. Probability therefore also points to
the view that the <i>nasî</i> was a genuine intercalation carried
out by a person appointed for the purpose, so that the dates
of the markets and the pilgrimage might be fixed at the proper
times of the year. For this no intercalary cycle was
employed, any more than elsewhere: the empirical intercalation
sufficed, and it was made known to the people at the
feast of pilgrims, whence the knowledge spread all over. However
the entrusting of such power over the calendar to one
individual lends itself only too easily to abuses with a view to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
ends which have nothing to do with the calendar. The stock example
is afforded by the Roman pontifices at the end of the Republic.
It is therefore nothing to wonder at that the calendar should
have been disorganised during Mohammed’s stay in Mecca.
Hence also the attempts at determining the calendar from two
or three certainly known dates are vain, for when a system
is lacking or is broken up it is impossible to compute a calendar
systematically from a couple of dates. Mohammed’s action
is thus to be explained:&mdash;The misuse of the intercalation
had destroyed the dependence of the pilgrimage upon the time
of the year: Mohammed wished to create order, and did so
in radical fashion by forbidding the intercalation, the misuse
of which he saw, but the usefulness of which he failed to
recognise.</p>

<p>It has been pointed out above that the Sumerian months
completely correspond in character to those of the primitive
peoples<a id="FNanchor_917" href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a>. The establishing of the months in their definite
places followed originally from the reference to the seasons,
not from the position in the series of months. The seasons
on their part were, as always, brought into relation to the phases
of the stars. There is indeed little information as to this
point, but what little there is is sufficient to establish it. It
is however much to be desired that specialists should pay
more attention to the matter and if possible procure more information.
The Pleiades are brought into connexion with the
annual inundations, which took place about the time of the
invisibility of these stars, i. e. between their evening setting
and morning rising<a id="FNanchor_918" href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a>. The name of the constellation Virgo
means ‘root of the sprouting wheat-stalk, or corn’, that of the
star Spica ‘proclaimer of the sprouting wheat-stalk’. These
names agree with the evening rising of this constellation,
which at the date 2,000 B. C. took place about the 28th of
February of our modern calendar, and with the morning setting,
which took place some 16 days later. Circumstances
exclude the ripening, which took place in the second half of
April.<a id="FNanchor_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> Consequently the months were also determined by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
the phases of the stars: among the names of months there is
one which points to this fact, ‘the month in which the white
star (<i>bar-zag</i>) sinks down from the culmination-point’<a id="FNanchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a>. The
naming of the months from the stars has not been carried
through consistently, but each month, just as e. g. among the
Maoris, was fixed by one or more risings of stars. There are
several lists in which now one, now two, or even three of the
fixed stars are assigned to each of the twelve months<a id="FNanchor_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a>. In
the Creation epic, Tablet V, 4 ff., we read:&mdash;“For twelve
months he set down three constellations, according to the times
of the year fashioned he the groups of stars.” Among the
Maoris all the stars suitable to the time in question are used
in the fixing of the month: in Babylonia there was probably
a gradual limitation to the stars of the ecliptic, i. e. the 12
signs of the zodiac, the number of which points to the fact
that they owe their origin to the endeavour to fix the twelve
months astronomically<a id="FNanchor_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a>. This is an important advance of
Babylonian stellar science, that the constellations of the ecliptic
should be separated from the others. Weidner, p. 21, inverts
matters when he says, with reference to a list in which,
instead of the fainter constellations of the zodiac, neighbouring
bright stars are given (e. g. Sirius instead of Cancer):&mdash;“The
system of the <i>paranatellonta</i> is also found already, i. e. the
system which allows neighbouring bright stars or constellations
to step in instead of less bright constellations of the zodiac.
But this is no longer primitive astronomy, it marks rather, as
Weissbach has already pointed out with reference to Newcomb-Engelmann,
the beginnings of a scientific astronomy.” On the
contrary, as the examples from the primitive peoples shew, in
the utilising of stars to fix a point of time or a month no notice
is originally taken of the position of the star within or
without the ecliptic, but the most easily recognisable stars and
constellations are naturally preferred, wherever they may be
situated. A list of fixed stars which determine months, including
also stars situated outside the ecliptic, is primitive;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
it is out of the question that a constellation outside the ecliptic
is referred to instead of a sign of the zodiac in the proper
sense&mdash;that in which the constellations of the zodiac are
to be regarded as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prius</i>. After the signs of the zodiac
have been fixed, so that a systematic duodecimal division of
the year has been obtained, the stars situated outside the
ecliptic are compared with the signs of the zodiac in order
to indicate with accuracy to which month they belong, or in
other words the system of the <i>paranatellonta</i> is found.</p>

<p>It is indispensable to enter into the all-important question
of the intercalation, but here opinions are so directly opposed
to one another that Weidner establishes a very accurate 38-year
intercalary cycle as early as the time of the dynasty of
Ur, while Kugler denies the existence of any intercalary cycle
before the year 528 B. C.; Kugler again publishes a document
in which an intercalary rule is recognised as dating from a
time after 504 B. C.<a id="FNanchor_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a>, while Weidner regards this as a copy
of a much older original. An impartial opinion can only be
arrived at by working through the material, and this is impossible
for anyone who is not an Assyriologist: I am all the
more compelled, therefore, to limit myself to suggestions and
to the comparison with primitive conditions<a id="FNanchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a>.</p>

<p>Where surplus months exist, there is no intercalation in
the proper sense, although the same name, e. g. the ‘harvest
month’, will recur sometimes after 12, sometimes after 13
months, since owing to the fluctuating and unstable nature of
the naming of the months the latter are distributed according
to circumstances<a id="FNanchor_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a>. This covers the difficulty. Such seems to
have been the state of affairs in the pre-Sargonic period at
Lagash. Certainly Kugler (II, 216) has tried to demonstrate
intercalary years: this is possible in the sense given above, but
actually very uncertain, since the starting-points for the arrangement
of the months are anything but certain<a id="FNanchor_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a>. Only the arising
of a fixed series of months makes a genuine intercalation
possible, since as a rule the general custom is to intercalate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
a definite month (in Babylonia, at least later, there were two
such months, <i>adarru</i> and <i>ululu</i>). The process is either an
omission of one month in the series of thirteen, or an intercalation
of one month in the series of twelve. The former
appears in Lagash in the time of Sargon, the latter in the time
of Dungi. We have found that the intercalation among the
primitive peoples takes place as need arises. If the series
of months is fixed, but the intercalation is neglected, the months
must get out of place in relation to the seasons: this can be
demonstrated in a couple of cases. So if the translation of
the name of the fourth month in the list from Lagash is correct&mdash;<i>šu-kul-na</i>,
‘sowing month’&mdash;the harvest month, <i>še-kin-kud</i>,
is the twelfth, and is therefore at a distance of eight
months instead of the five which the natural conditions shew<a id="FNanchor_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a>.
Further the list at the time of Dungi shews a disarrangement of
the months as compared with the Sargonic list, the tenth month
having dropped out and the following months being now pushed
one place forwards. This difference can be explained
either by a neglect of the intercalation, or by the fluctuating
nature of the nomenclature: in the latter case there is really
no genuine intercalation.</p>

<p>At the time of Dungi and his successors we have documentary
evidence for a number of years with intercalation.<a id="FNanchor_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a>
At this date Kugler stoutly denies and Weidner supports the
existence of an intercalary cycle. Weidner says:&mdash;“If we
denote Dungi 39 (the 39th year of his reign) by I, the following
years are proved by documents to contain intercalary
months:&mdash;II, V, XI, XIV, XVI, XVIII, XX, XXIII, XXVI,
XXIX, XXXII, XXXV, XXXVIII. But between Dungi 43 and
49 there is at least one more leap-year to be added, most
probably Dungi 46, i. e. VIII. For the period of 38 years we
should then have 14 intercalary months attested. This is therefore
an intercalary system that works quite well. A 19-year
intercalary cycle however it cannot be, since in that case,
corresponding to the former part, the years XXI, XXIV, etc.
in the latter would have to be leap-years. <em>We have therefore to
assume a 38-year intercalary cycle, which in perfection far surpasses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
that of 19 years.</em> It is the half of the well-known 76-year
cycle of Callippus.” The conclusion is unwarrantable from the
premises. For the intercalation which takes place just as need
arises keeps the months firmly in their place in the solar year,
and attains the same result as an intercalary cycle. A period
of 76 Indian years will contain just as many months as a Callippean
cycle. The only conclusive factor therefore is the
periodicity, and this is not proved. Through an accident of
tradition the leap-years are known for a period of 38 years,
and it is obvious that during these 38 years an empirical intercalation,
regularly carried out, kept the lunisolar year in order.
The evidence that even under the Hammurabi dynasty no
intercalary cycle existed is given by Kugler<a id="FNanchor_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a>.</p>

<p>But there is also direct evidence that the intercalation
took place empirically, i. e. as need arose. Ungnad has shewn
this from a comparison of the known leap-years. Best known
of all is the letter of Hammurabi to Siniddinam:&mdash;“Since the
year has a deficiency, let the previous month be entered as
Elul II. And instead of bringing the taxes on the 25th Tishritu
to Babylon, let them be brought to Babylon on the 25th
Elul II”<a id="FNanchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a>. For the empirical correcting of the position of months
the stars are used among the primitive peoples, and so also in
Babylonia. A tablet in the British Museum<a id="FNanchor_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a> gives the following
injunction:&mdash;“The constellation <i>dilgan</i> rises heliacally
in the month <i>nisan</i>. As often as this constellation remains
invisible, its month shall be forgotten”. The same injunction is
given in regard to other constellations from which months are
named. The expression that the month Nisan is to be ‘forgotten’
reminds one of the description of the intercalary month
as the ‘lost’ or ‘forgotten’ month among certain tribes of N.
American Indians, and of the expression of the Masai. The
forgotten month is not the intercalary month in our sense, i. e.
not the second of two months that have arisen by doubling; it
is the first. This month must be passed over, not counted,
forgotten, its name must be transferred to the following month,
so that the year may run properly. The establishing of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
months by means of phases of the stars is so abundantly demonstrated
for primitive peoples in the preceding pages that
no words need be wasted in describing the method of its carrying
out. It is a method that works perfectly well but is entirely
empirical, and where recourse is had to this method we
know that the regulation by a definite intercalary cycle does
not exist. With a more extended development of the method
a still better result can be obtained, and this is the direction
that the Babylonians have taken. The regulation runs:&mdash;“If
on the first day of the month <i>nisannu</i> the constellation of
the Pleiades and the moon are together, the year shall be an
ordinary one. If on the third day of the month <i>nisannu</i> the
constellation of the Pleiades and the moon stand together, the
year shall be a full one (i. e. a leap-year)”<a id="FNanchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a>. The meaning
and effect of this rule are explained by Schiaparelli. But this
too is an empirical rule, aimed at an empirical, not a cyclical,
intercalation. Where an intercalary cycle exists, no such rule
is needed.</p>

<p>Since by the letter of Hammurabi it is indisputably established
that the intercalation took place not in years previously
determined but at the command of the king, those who
in spite of this would maintain the existence of an intercalary
cycle hold to the assertion that the 27-year intercalary period
was not a strictly fixed but a free cycle. In other words the
intercalation rule only runs:&mdash;“Within a period of 27 years
10 intercalary months are to be inserted, but the choice of the
leap-years is left open to the astronomer”<a id="FNanchor_933" href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a>. But this is nothing
less than an abandonment of the intercalary cycle. The purpose
of such a cycle is to render it possible to compute the
calendar beforehand for any number of years to come, and
this purpose is frustrated by a regulation of this kind. It only
says that in <em>x</em> years <em>y</em> intercalary months occur: this is not
a rule for intercalation but an empirical observation, which
readily results from a proper treatment of the empirical intercalation.
Such observations must have been made by the Babylonians.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
In a tablet published by Kugler it is said of Saturn
and of the fixed star <i>kak-si-di</i>, respectively, “ ... the period
of the visibility of Sirius amounts to 27 years. Turn back and
consider day after day,” according to Weidner, p. 73; according
to Kugler I, 47 the inscription runs, “Day by day ... shalt
thou see (the same phenomena as 59, or 27, years before).”
Both Kugler and Weidner find here a 27-year intercalary
cycle regulated by the star; the former places it before
533 B. C., the latter at a considerably earlier period. But in
accordance with what has here been said about the empirical
regulation of the intercalation by phases of the stars it follows
that there is no intercalation at all, but only the empirical
verification of the fact that the new moon and Sirius come
back after 27 years into the same mutual relationship:
this will actually be the result with an accurate treatment
of the intercalation based on the observation of this constellation.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it would have been an easy
matter to establish an intercalary cycle, but the demand for
this is an affair of practical life: astronomy is concerned only
with the calculation. The failure to observe this fact has led
the discussion astray. The calendar is of course the most
conservative of all human things; centuries after the establishment
of very accurate calculations of the course of the
moon and the introduction of a good intercalary cycle, the
Jews adhered to the empirical observation of the new moon,
and we know how difficult it is in modern times to introduce
any improvement into the calendar. Because in Babylon there
was a central government which could arrange the intercalation
in proper fashion, the lunisolar year was kept in order, and
in practical life there was no necessity to be able to calculate
months and days for several years in advance. The empirical
intercalation worked well, and there was no need to replace
it by an intercalary cycle. The latter is indeed a simplification
undertaken on practical grounds, an intercalating rule
being substituted for the immediate astronomical observation:
<ins class="corr" id="tn-264" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'astromony is'">
astronomy is</ins> concerned only with the calculation and with the
further refinement of the rule. In so far as I am able to pronounce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
upon the material Kugler is right: no cyclically regulated
intercalation existed before the Persian period; but from this
it is in no way possible to arrive at any decision as to the
position of the Babylonian astronomy. The regulation of the
months by the phases of the stars was a suggestive problem
for the astronomers, and it led to the recognition of the periodicity
of the phenomena. This is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prius</i>, not the desired
establishment of an intercalary cycle.</p>

<p>A second means of fixing the months in their position
in the solar year is afforded by the regulation by the solstices
and equinoxes; but since, as will be shown in the following
chapter, the observation of these is difficult and is seldom
undertaken, a regulation of this nature is correspondingly rare.
It can be demonstrated for the Eskimos<a id="FNanchor_934" href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a>, the Kwakiutl<a id="FNanchor_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a>, and
the Hopi, whose 13 ‘sun-points’ doubtless correspond to the
13 months<a id="FNanchor_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a>. Of the Basuto it is said that an attempt is made
to determine the time of sowing from the moon, but that the
people commonly go wrong in their reckoning, and after much
dispute are obliged to fall back upon the climatic conditions
and the state of the vegetation as more certain marks for the
time of sowing. Intelligent chiefs, however, rectify the calendar
(i. e. the moon-months) by the summer solstice, which they
call the summer house of the sun<a id="FNanchor_937" href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a>.</p>

<p>The risings and settings of the stars, as has been shewn
above, are brought into relation with the seasons. There is a
possibility of bringing these sidereally determined seasons into
a system. Thus the year of the Luiseño Indians of S. California
consists of 2 × 8 divisions, which are determined by the
morning rising of certain stars<a id="FNanchor_938" href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a>. This is however an isolated
case, since the reckoning by months has penetrated almost
everywhere, and both seasons and risings of stars are brought
into connexion with this. The most complete example is seen
in the months of the Maoris<a id="FNanchor_939" href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a>. Moreover the creation of such
a system was not possible among the primitive peoples, since
for the purpose of determining time they were only accustomed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
to observe a few stars, principally the Pleiades. On the other
hand the observation of the stars plays a great part in another
matter not necessarily connected with the reckoning of the
months, viz. the beginning of the year, and to this we shall
now turn our attention.</p>

<span class="fs70">CALENDAR REGULATION. 2. BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy1">The question of the beginning of the year presents some
difficulties, since it is for the most part quite uncertain
what meaning is to be attached to the phrase ‘beginning of the
year’. For us the new year is the great division in the calendar,
and one which is emphasised by a special festival day
and by various rites. This is an inheritance from ancient
Rome; in particular the extremely wide-spread and popular
astrology has powerfully contributed to the importance of New
Year’s Day<a id="FNanchor_940" href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a>. In ancient Greece the New Year’s Day was of
no great importance: its position varied greatly in each of
the small states; it was little more than the day on which
the annually changing officials entered upon their terms of
office. In the case of the primitive peoples the new year need
not in itself be regarded as a very important division of the
calendar: it has however become so among more highly developed
peoples. For instance, the enumeration of the seasons
or the months must begin somewhere; for this reason a
beginning of the year must be supposed, but it is not therefore
certain that the new year acquires any special importance.
Of the inhabitants of the Torres Straits Islands Rivers
says that when asked about the seasons they more than once
began their list with <i>surlal</i>, and he is of the opinion that the
beginning of this season is for them practically the beginning
of a new year<a id="FNanchor_941" href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a>. Of the Kiwai Papuans Landtman writes to
me:&mdash;The year has no beginning, since there is no term to
describe this, and it cannot be said that one season more than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
another marks an occasion of greater importance. The people
begin their list of months sometimes with <i>keke</i>, the first month
of the dry season, sometimes with <i>karongo</i>, which marks the
transitional period between the dry and the rainy seasons.</p>

<p>It will be well to begin our investigation with the natural
divisions of the year. The changing seasons give several
divisions one or other of which, according to preference, can
be chosen as the beginning of the year. But this is not the case
among the agricultural peoples. Their year falls into two parts,
the period of vegetation and the time of rest intervening between
the harvest and the resumption of ploughing. There are
therefore two natural main divisions, the beginning of labour
and the conclusion of the period of vegetation, the harvest.
Both occur as the beginning of the year, the former however
more rarely, as when among the Wadschagga ‘the raising of
the plough-stick’ is also the ‘opening of the year’<a id="FNanchor_942" href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a>. More frequently
the harvest and the great festival associated with it
form the turning-point of the year. Probably however we should
rather speak of an end than of a beginning of the year, as is
remarked by one writer in regard to the Dyaks of south-east
Borneo:&mdash;For them the rice-harvest is a principal division of
the year (<i>njelo</i>). In September, at the completion of the harvest,
the year is at an end. A definite beginning, a New Year’s
Day, is unknown among them<a id="FNanchor_943" href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a>. However when the year is
reckoned continuously, beginning and end practically coincide.</p>

<p>In the literature of comparative religion festivals of this
nature are a much-discussed problem which cannot be gone
into here, since it transgresses the limits of this investigation.
I shall give only a few selected examples in order to make
clear the relationship with the beginning of the year. Among
the Carolina Indians the feast of the first-fruits or harvest was
the most splendid of all: it appears to have ended the old
year and begun the new. It began in August when the corn-harvest
was completely over. As a preliminary all the inhabitants
provided themselves with new clothes, new pots, pans,
and other household utensils, and then collected all their old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
clothes and other worn-out things, swept and cleaned their
houses, places of assemblage, and the whole town, and threw
clothes and refuse, together with all the remaining supplies of
food (corn etc.), on to a heap, to which they afterwards set
fire. After this they took physic, and fasted for three days,
and a general amnesty was proclaimed. On the fourth morning
the chief priest kindled fire with pieces of wood at the
public meeting-place, by which means every house in the town
was then provided with fire. Then the women went to the harvest-field,
fetched new corn, prepared it, and brought it with
pomp to the meeting-place, where the whole populace was
assembled in new clothes. Eating went on, especially among
the men, and at night they danced. The festival lasted three
days, and on the four following days visits were paid to neighbouring
towns<a id="FNanchor_944" href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a>. The New Year festival of the Konkau of
California is a funeral rite which has undergone transformation.
The ‘Dance for the Dead’ took place at the end of
August; from evening until daybreak the people danced around
a fire, into which food, strings of shell-money, and other small
articles were thrown. Our authority does not know how the
date was fixed, but the festival marked the new year, and this
opportunity was taken to wipe out all old debts and settle
accounts for the year that was to come<a id="FNanchor_945" href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a>. Among the Amazulu
the feast of the first-fruits is called the ‘New Year’. Medicine
staffs are everywhere set up in order to prevent ‘heaven’
from entering. At the end of the year new staffs are set up
instead of the old ones; then the people know that the old
heaven of the year has passed away with the year that is
ended: the new year has its own heaven<a id="FNanchor_946" href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a>. In the neighbourhood
of Mombasa the new year is celebrated with fair regularity
in September, after the maize-harvest; for a whole week
there is dancing day and night<a id="FNanchor_947" href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a>. Among the Thonga there
are several feasts of the first-fruits, <i>luma</i>. When the Caffre
corn, <i>mabele</i>, is ripe, the wife of the chief grinds the first
grains reaped, and cooks them. The chief eats a little and
offers some to the spirits of his ancestors with the words:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
“Here is the new year come”, and prays for fruitfulness. At
the ripening of the Caffre plum, from which a drink is extracted,
some of the drink is poured out on to the graves of
dead chiefs with the words:&mdash;“This is the new year. Let
us not fight! Let us eat in peace!” Among the Nkuma the
ceremony of the first-fruits is performed with a special kind
of pumpkin, and is called ‘eating the new year’<a id="FNanchor_948" href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a>. On the
Lower Niger, among the Owu-Waji, the year is terminated by
the feast of roasted yams, which also serves as a public
announcement that the labours of the field are to be resumed.
Homage is paid to Ifejioku, god of the harvest, in token of
gratitude for a good and fruitful year<a id="FNanchor_949" href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a>. On the Society Islands
a festival was celebrated with a great banquet, and this was
called ‘the ripening or consummation of the year’<a id="FNanchor_950" href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a>. The greatest
feast of the Dyaks is <i>dangei</i>, the celebration of the new
rice-year after the harvest; but if the harvest fails, the festival
is suspended<a id="FNanchor_951" href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a>. Among the Yoruba <i>odun</i> means year,
an annual festival celebrated in October and the time between
two such festivals<a id="FNanchor_952" href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a>.</p>

<p>The new year is equivalent to the new harvest, the new
supplies of food which through the raising of the taboo are
blessed and made accessible. Where there are several fruits
which ripen at different times there may be several ‘new year
festivals’, as among the Thonga, but usually there is one principal
sowing-time and consequently only one festival. A festival
of this nature forms the great division of the year, and
this fact is emphasised by the ceremonies which aim at clearing
away everything old and beginning again. In this way the
change of the year acquires great significance, but this is not
universally the case.</p>

<p>More rarely some other natural phenomenon gives rise to
the celebration of the change of the year, e. g. the appearance
of the palolo, the favourite delicacy of Samoa: but since the
palolo appears at different times near different islands, the turn
of the year varies accordingly<a id="FNanchor_953" href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a>.</p>

<p>A festival of this nature is originally not a calendar festival,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
and only on account of its special significance does it become
of importance for the calendar: it is not a universal
phenomenon. In different districts the position of the beginning
of the year varies greatly. Among the North American
Indians many tribes began the year at the spring equinox,
others in the autumn, the Hopi with the ‘new fire’ in November,
the Takulli in January<a id="FNanchor_954" href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a>. The Kiowa began the year at
the commencement of winter, which was signalised by the
first snow-fall, or according to other statements a month earlier,
with the first cold, the Pawnee with winter, the Teton-Sioux
and the Cheyenne immediately before the winter<a id="FNanchor_955" href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a>, the
Klamath and Modok in August, after the <i>wokash</i>-harvest<a id="FNanchor_956" href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a>, the
Chocktaw of Louisiana in December<a id="FNanchor_957" href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a>, the Natchez in March,
when they celebrated a great festival<a id="FNanchor_958" href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a>. As a rule the Thompson Indians
of British Columbia count their moons beginning at
the rutting-season of the deer in November, but some begin
with the end of the rutting-season at the end of November:
others, particularly Shamans, with the rutting-season of the
big-horn sheep. Many peoples of the Lytton band begin when
the ground-hogs go into their winter dens. Many of the Lower
Thompsons begin with the rutting-season of the mountain-goats.
Some moons are called by numbers only, but those following
the tenth moon are not numbered<a id="FNanchor_959" href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a>. The Shuswap in the same
country connected the year with the same moon as the Thompson
Indians, although most of them entered their winter houses
a month earlier<a id="FNanchor_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a>. Among the Hudson Bay Eskimos the year
begins when the sun has reached its lowest position at the winter
solstice<a id="FNanchor_961" href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a>. The first month of the Koryak of N. E. Asia begins
at the time of the winter solstice, and corresponds to our
December<a id="FNanchor_962" href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a>. It has already been mentioned that the East
Greenlanders also began to count their months at the winter
solstice, but later at the morning rising of Altair<a id="FNanchor_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a>. It will be
seen that the beginning of the year has no common position
marked out by Nature, although we may perhaps say that it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
usually falls somewhere during the period of rest, while
the peculiar natural conditions under which the Eskimos live
make it easy to understand why their year should be begun
with the eagerly awaited return of the sun. Among many
peoples little attention seems to have been paid to the matter,
since no special prominence is given to the beginning of the
year, although lists of months are given. But where these
lists exist, and it is desired to enumerate the months, a beginning
must be made somewhere, and a fixed initial month
very easily arises.</p>

<p>The dispute already touched upon<a id="FNanchor_964" href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a> as to the beginning
of the Israelitish year is very characteristic of the matter in
hand<a id="FNanchor_965" href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a>. It is easy to understand why no unity has been arrived
at, since the conception of the beginning of the year is
fluctuating and capable of many interpretations. When in the
oldest codes of the law it is said of the feast of in-gathering
(namely of fruit, wine, and oil) that it is to be celebrated at the
end of the year or that it marks the ‘turning’ of the year<a id="FNanchor_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a>,
Dillman is right in describing this year as an economic one.
From the very beginning the feast is a feast of the end of the
year<a id="FNanchor_967" href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a>. Only as the agricultural year is extended into a complete
year does it become a feast of the turn, and finally of
the beginning, of the year.</p>

<p>The beginning of the agricultural year, however, still does
not imply a calendar year, though certainly it furnishes occasion
for the establishment of the beginning of the year when a
calendar arises. Even in the year 600, at least in Gezer, no
fixed series of months was known<a id="FNanchor_968" href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a>, the Canaanitish months
not having been universally adopted. The old custom of
reckoning the months from an arbitrary and accidental point
of departure prevailed and long sufficed. The beginning of
the year in autumn was no calendrical division, but only the
conclusion of the agricultural year. When a calendar was
introduced, it became obvious that this beginning of the year
would also be available for the calendar. The calendar now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
consists of moon-months, its beginning must therefore be a day
of new moon. Since the festival of harvest, according to
ancient custom, fell at the time of full moon, the festival itself
could not serve as the beginning of the year, but only the day
of new moon of the month in which it fell. This was the
seventh month, and we do in fact find indications that the first
day of the seventh month was regarded as New Year’s Day;
it was promoted to a feast day and was made known by the
blowing of trumpets<a id="FNanchor_969" href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a>. The year therefore could be reckoned
from this point, and this also was done. On the other hand
the numbered months mentioned <a href="#Page_233">above, p. 233</a>, begin in spring
with the month in which the Passover is celebrated. The beginning
of the year in spring is therefore associated with the
numbered months, and is contemporaneous with these: it is
nothing but the starting-point of this enumeration of months.
The rule for the beginning is given in Exodus XII, 2:&mdash;“This
month (i. e. the Passover month) shall be unto you the beginning
of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.”
This reads like a prescription for a reform of the calendar,
when it is remembered that in all places the Feast of the
Passover was dated in relation to the month of ears (<i>chodesh
ha-abib</i>). That the numbered months did not arise till later
we have already seen (p. 234). The systematising tendency
which arose at the end of the kingdom of Judah, and became
ever stronger during and after the Exile, necessitated a calendar.
If this tendency was unrelated to practical life, it was
all the more closely bound up with the religious cult. Since
people were now accustomed to numbering the months, the
novelty consisted in the fixing of a calendarial beginning of
the year. This was suggested by the customary succession
of the feasts&mdash;Passover and Feast of Unleavened Bread, Feast
of Weeks, Feast of Tabernacles&mdash;and was already foreshadowed
in the fixing of the date of the Feast of Weeks by
counting the weeks from the Feast of Unleavened Bread. This
calendar can hardly have become popular, since it must have
been supplanted quite early by the Babylonian names of months,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
and the popular beginning of the year in autumn has prevailed
right down to the present day.</p>

<p>These two beginnings to the year existed side by side,
at least for some time after the Exile, which is not surprising
in view of what has already been said about the beginning of
the year. The one is the civil beginning of the year, advanced
by the structure of the calendar, the other the beginning
of the series of months.</p>

<p>The Jewish calendar therefore arose very late, at the
end of the kingdom of Judah; until that time the Jews were
content with a chronology which was as primitive as that of
many primitive peoples. In matters pertaining to the calendar
they have always been very conservative and backward. In
later times, too, they did not succeed in grasping the idea of
the beginning of the year as a solitary event. König quotes
on p. 644 a very significant passage from the Mishna tractate
concerning the beginning of the year:&mdash;“On the first day of
Nisan is the beginning of the year for the kings and for the
festivals. On the first day of Elul is the beginning for the
tithing of cattle. On the first day of Tishri is the beginning
for the years (i. e. the civil calendar), and for the Sabbatic
year and the Jubilee years, for the plants and the vegetables.
On the first day of the month Shebat is the beginning for
the tree-fruit.”&mdash;Four New Year’s Days, therefore.</p>

<p>Among the Jews, therefore, ecclesiastical conditions gave
rise to a calendarial beginning of the year, which successfully
rivalled the beginning given by the agricultural year. There is
still another important type of beginning, and this depends once
more upon the observation of the stars; cp. <a href="#Page_248">pp. 248 f</a>. Where the
beginning of the agricultural labour is determined by the Pleiades,
it evidently follows that they also determine the beginning
of the year. It follows further that the year lasts not
only to the end of the period of vegetation, but also until the
next appearance of the Pleiades, and hence the sidereal year
is obtained at once with the greatest accuracy that is possible
without scientific observation. This Pleiades year is especially
common in South America, where there are no series of months,
and in Oceania.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span></p>

<p>The Lengua Indians of Paraguay connect the rising of the
Pleiades with the beginning of spring, and hold feasts during
this time<a id="FNanchor_970" href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a>. The Guarani of the same country determine the
time of sowing by the observation of the Pleiades; it is said
that they used to worship this constellation, and they begin
their new year at its appearance in May<a id="FNanchor_971" href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a>. In the Amazon
valley the rising of the Pleiades coincides with the revival of
Nature, and hence the people say that everything is renewed
by these stars<a id="FNanchor_972" href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a>. The Indians of the Orinoco determined the new
year by the evening rising of the Pleiades<a id="FNanchor_973" href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a>. But still further, the
year is called by the name of the Pleiades. Certain tribes of
Venezuela reckoned the year by stars, and in fact by the
Pleiades. ‘Year’ is <i>tshirke</i>, ‘star’, a year = a star. The word
occurs in various forms among most of the Carib tribes; among
the neighbouring Caribs <i>tshirika</i> is found many times as a
translation of ‘the Pleiades’. The connexion becomes clear
in the wide-spread Carib idiom of the Guaianas: in a Galibi
dictionary ‘star’ and ‘year’ are given as <i>serica</i>, <i>siricco</i>, the
Pleiades as <i>sherick</i>, and we read in brackets: “The return of
the Pleiades above the horizon together with the sun forms
the solar year of the natives.” Among the island Caribs the
Pleiades are called <i>chiric</i>; these people reckon the years in
‘Pleiades’. Among the Arawak <i>wijua</i> means ‘Pleiades’, ‘star’
in general, and ‘year’, since they reckon the year from the
point at which they see the Pleiades rise after cock-crow.
The Cariay of the Rio Negro call the Pleiades <i>eoünana</i> and
the year <i>aurema-anynoa</i>, which seems to be a development of
the former word. The Guarani call the Pleiades <i>eishu</i>, ‘bee-hive’,
and the year has the same name; in ordinary life however
the year is usually known as <i>roi</i>, ‘cold’<a id="FNanchor_974" href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a>.</p>

<p>The Caffres recognise the time of sowing by the position
of the stars, especially the Pleiades, and reckon the new year
from the morning rising of the latter<a id="FNanchor_975" href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a>. Although the Amazulu
call the feast of the first-fruits the new year, they say at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
appearance of the Pleiades: “The Pleiades are renewed, the year
is renewed”, and they begin to dig<a id="FNanchor_976" href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a>. In Bali the appearance
of the Pleiades at sunset marks the end of the year<a id="FNanchor_977" href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a>. In
Bambatana (Solomon Islands) the year is reckoned by the
Pleiades<a id="FNanchor_978" href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a>. Among the Polynesians the Pleiades year was extremely
wide-spread. The inhabitants of the Marquesas Islands
had a ten-month year, but were acquainted with a year of
twelve months, which they called by the name of the Pleiades,
<i>maka-ihi</i> or <i>mata-iti</i>, ‘the little eyes’<a id="FNanchor_979" href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a>. On Hervey Island the
new year was given by the evening rising of the Pleiades in
the middle of December<a id="FNanchor_980" href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a>. In the Society Islands there were
two seasons named after the Pleiades. The first, <i>matarii i nia</i>,
‘little eyes above’, began at the evening rising of these stars
and continued as long as they were visible in the sky in the
evening; the other <i>matarii i raro</i>, ‘little eyes under’, began
after the evening setting and extended over the time during
which the stars were not to be seen in the evening<a id="FNanchor_981" href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a>.</p>

<p>It follows that a fixed beginning of the year does not exist
universally, and therefore is not the general norm. The beginning
of the year in our sense is the starting-point of the series of the
days of the calendar; among the primitive peoples it is the beginning
of any year, whether the complete year or the phenomena
of the time of vegetation only. There are several such
phenomena appearing side by side, so that there can also be
several beginnings to the year, e. g. several feasts of first-fruits,
as among the Thonga, the rising of the Pleiades and
the feast of the first-fruits among the Amazulu. When one
phenomenon of this kind, e. g. the corn-harvest, prevails over
the others and is perhaps brought into prominence by the
greatest festival of the year, it appears more like our New Year,
though the significance of the occasion does not depend, as
among ourselves, upon the position of the day in the calendar,
but upon the natural conditions. And when a phase of the
stars, e. g. of the Pleiades, coincides with the beginning of the
agricultural year and the renewal of Nature, the stellar (Pleiades)
year is obtained by comprising the time between one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
rising or setting and the next. By this means we arrive at
the pure but undivided solar year. On the other hand the
phases of the stars, like the other natural phases, were needed
to determine the months, and here the result was more important.</p>

<p>With regard to the intercalation, the equalising of the
total number of moon-months and the solar year, the problem
first arose when there had been developed a fixed series of
months which it was desired to repeat without interruption.
Then arose the necessity of introducing an occasional month
into the series of twelve months, or omitting one from the
series of thirteen, so that the months named from natural
phases might remain in their proper places. This difficulty
was first of all blended with that arising from the fluctuation
of the natural phases due to the varying climatic conditions
of different years. The expedient was crudely empirical, the
occasional leaping over or addition of a month. Gradually it
became the custom to introduce the intercalary month at a
definite point; it may also be associated with a so-called ‘vacant
period’. Where a month was named from a phase of a
certain star, the correction was given automatically by this
phase, since this month was fixed. The intercalary month obtained
its place before this month, which became the beginning
of the year, since the reckoning started with it. By this means
was given a lunisolar year which was however empirically
regulated by occasional intercalation.</p>

<h3 class="p2">APPENDIX: THE EGYPTIAN YEAR.</h3>

<p>Upon the quite peculiar Egyptian time-reckoning I have
only a few remarks to make by way of addition to the clear
and convincing account of its origin given by Eduard Meyer;
as to the disarrangement of the names of months familiar to
us, which are borrowed from festivals, I must admit I am not
quite clear, but this matters little for our present purpose since
these names are more than two thousand years younger than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
the introduction of the year. The Egyptian year consists of
three seasons&mdash;time of inundation, seed-time, and harvest&mdash;each
of four months containing thirty days each, together with
five additional days, the epagomena, standing outside the year
and theoretically not included in it. The month is therefore
the round month and the year the round year, which by multiplying
the round number of the months in the year by the
round number of days in the month gives a total of 360 (12 × 30)
days. The use of round numbers in the arithmetical application
of the calendar is familiar in all quarters of the world
and has been known at all times; it is continued in the practice
of our modern banks in calculating interest <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à l’usance</i>. The
surprising thing is that in Egypt no notice should have been
taken of the moon, and that the month should have been
carried through as a mere numerical unity. For at the stage
of knowledge presupposed by the regulation of the calendar
the Egyptians must have known that the number of days in
the moon-month varies between 29 and 30. I am therefore
inclined to think that this form of year was first introduced as
a means of counting in administration and the making of returns,
and then by degrees established itself as the civil calendar
because the rural life was so closely dependent upon
the administration and its accounts. We may compare the
fact that the lunisolar calendar of Greece was introduced as
an ecclesiastical calendar, and succeeded in establishing itself
as the civil calendar owing to the close connexion between
the religious and the political life; but the old reckoning from
the phases of the stars persisted alongside of it. In the same
way we must suppose that in Egypt alongside of the numerical
calendar the old method of reckoning by the concrete
appearance of the moon originally persisted, but since by this
time it had lost its practical importance it vanished without
leaving any other traces than the length of the arithmetical
month (as a round number) and the name ‘month’.</p>

<p>On the other hand it must have been intended to give to
the year the length of the solar year: the five extra days
were accordingly introduced outside the series of months. Hence
the same word <i>wepet ronpet</i> means both the first day of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
civil shifting year and also the day of the actual morning
rising of Sirius; hence too the three four-month divisions of
the shifting year are called after the seasons. The first of
these, the time of inundation, began exactly with the morning
rising of Sirius when the Nile began perceptibly to rise. Here
the Egyptians went wrong because they did not realise that
the year does not consist of exactly 365 days, but contains an
additional fraction of a day. The consequence was that the
Egyptian year got out of place in relation to the solar year,
but so slowly that no inconvenience was caused in practical
life: the linguistic difficulty, that <i>wepet ronpet</i> acquired two
different meanings and that e. g. the season called the time
of inundation might fall in the actual seed-time or harvest,
the conservative minds of the Egyptians enabled them to tolerate.
A contributing factor was the practical convenience of
the calendar. The dislocation must however very soon have
been recognised, since the actual morning rising of Sirius, so
far as we know, was always celebrated, i. e. it was a movable
feast in relation to the calendar. The error is included in
the well-known formula of the Sothic period (1461 Egyptian =
1460 Julian years).</p>

<p>The knowledge of the closest approximation that can be
made to the correct number of days in the year, reckoning
only whole days, can only be arrived at in one of two ways,
either by the observations of the solstices and equinoxes, which
is the method adopted e. g. by the Hopi, or by means of the
rising of a star. The duration of the solar year is not reached
by way of the lunisolar year. Which of the two methods the
Egyptians adopted is not in doubt. No notice has come before
me which suggests that the Egyptians observed the position
of the sunrise or sunset on the horizon, while the stars
on the other hand were accurately observed by them. There
are calendars which give the position of the constellations in
accordance with which the hours of night were determined
and proclaimed<a id="FNanchor_982" href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a>, and in particular the morning rising of Sirius
was at all times observed and celebrated. This is primitive<a id="FNanchor_983" href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
but not so the counting of the days between two risings. The
latter process would be facilitated if the reckoning was previously
carried out in numerical months of 30 days (naturally
as a round number, not as an actual month); perhaps this was
the first stage. The calendar therefore, as Ed. Meyer has
specially pointed out, must have begun to run its course in a
year in which the rising of Sirius and New Year’s Day coincided,
i. e. it began with a Sothic period.</p>

<p>The months within each season are numbered from I to
IV. Among primitive peoples it frequently happens that a
season gives its name to two months, which are distinguished
as the first and second, but a numbering such as that of the
Egyptian calendar is unexampled and shews once more a
desire to get away from the moon-month. The so-called ‘months’
are rather subdivisions of the seasons.</p>

<p>The breach&mdash;and it can be considered no less&mdash;with
the primitive time-reckoning is part negative, part positive.
Positively, the length of the solar year in whole days has been
astonishingly early recognised, but the greatest advance is in
the negative direction. The calendar has been detached from
the concrete phenomena of the heavens: thereby it acquires
a numerical character, and only so is the genuine time-reckoning
created. For in practice it is more necessary to be able
to reckon conveniently than to remain in accurate agreement
with the incommensurability of the motions of the heavenly
bodies. Hence the Egyptian calendar held good, although
its year was a shifting year and in spite of the fact that the
ideal year underlying it was a sidereal and not the actual
solar year, and the Greek astronomers reckoned by it on
account of its convenience, just as our astronomers still reckon
by the Julian calendar. The Egyptian year therefore lies at
the bottom of our year, which has been altered so as to remain
in agreement with the seasons,&mdash;this being necessary in
view of the spread of the historic sense among the people&mdash;but
has also unfortunately been spoiled in the division into
months, owing to the influence of the Roman months. The
Egyptian calendar is the greatest intellectual fact in the
history of time-reckoning; like all the greatest achievements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
of this nature, e. g. the alphabet, it was attained through a
radical simplification, in which also practical convenience played
a great part. It should not be forgotten that astronomy and
the calendar are not identical. In matters of the calendar
practical utility is more welcome than refined astronomical
calculation.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-capy1">In ancient times, and even at the present day in lands which
lie outside the path of the great leveller, civilisation, the
months taken over with the Roman calendar are not numbered
divisions of the year, the names of which are a matter of indifference,
but are concretely conceived and named as seasons.
They are, in fact, nothing but seasons, the number and duration
of which are determined by the conventional calendar. The
striving after concreteness which characterises not too highly
civilised man leads to the abolition of the obscure and unintelligible
Roman names of months, and the substitution of other
names describing the season, or more rarely taken from some
great festival falling within the month. Only the Hungarian
months are entirely named after ecclesiastical festivals<a id="FNanchor_984" href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a>. It
is also found that the Latin names are as far as possible rendered
intelligible by popular etymology.</p>

<p>These statements are well illustrated by the names given
to the months by the Greek peasants of Macedonia. It is said
of the latter that they measure time not so much by the conventional
calendar as by the labours and the festivals characteristic
of the different seasons. Seed-time, harvest and vintage,
the feast of Saint George, the midsummer fires are some
of the notable occasions in the life of the peasant, and these
have impressed themselves upon the names of the months.
The names are:&mdash;1, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Γεννάρης</span>, derived from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γεννοῦν</span>, also called

<p>The various Celtic series I omit<a id="FNanchor_987" href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a>, since they are very

remark that they shew a mixture of distorted Latin and of
native names, the latter being taken, at least in part, from the
phenomena of the vegetation. The Basque names of months
are:&mdash;1, New Year month or black month; 2, bull or wolf
month; 3, tepid month; 4, weeding or fasting-bread month; 5,
leaf month; 6, seed-time (<em>sic!</em>), bean or barley month; 7, harvest
or wheat month; 8, month of drought; 9, fern or ear month;
10, gathering month; 11, sowing month or forest-clearing; 12,
binding up of vegetation (?). They refer therefore throughout<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
to the vegetation and to agriculture. For four months the Latin
names are also in use<a id="FNanchor_988" href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a>.</p>

<p>I have purposely placed in the foreground these mingled
series arising in modern times, since they shew how little the
people can reconcile themselves to the unintelligible Latin
names, and how the latter are crowded out by native names which
by their relation to seasons, occupations, and festivals offer
points of reference easy to remember. The months are nothing
but seasons, the length and situation of which are regulated
by the Julian calendar.</p>

<p>The Lithuanian and Lettish names of months refer exclusively
to natural phenomena and the occupations of agriculture.
The Lithuanian series is:&mdash;1, unexplained; 2, jackdaw
month; 3, dove month; 4, birch month, or birch water-flowing;
5, cuckoo month; 6, fallow or sowing month; 7, linden month;
8, hot month or rye-cutting; 9, autumn month; 10, leaf-fall; 11,
month of clods; 12, month of dryness (frost). The Lettish names
are:&mdash;1, winter month; 2, snow or fasting-month; 3, dove or
snow-crust month; 4, birch-sap month; 5, leaf month; 6, fallow
or blossoming month; 7, hay or linden month; 8, rye month or
dog (-days); 9, heath-blossom month; 10, autumn month; 11,
frost month; 12, wolf month or Christmas<a id="FNanchor_989" href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a>.</p>

<p>Very similar but much more numerous and fluctuating
are the names of months among the Slavonic peoples, collected
by Miklosich along with the names of months of a number of
other peoples. Yermoloff in his great work on the popular
Russian calendar gives only a limited number of names, and
these are rarely translated: with a few exceptions these names
will be found in Miklosich. The latter writer has classified and
discussed the names under their proper headings as follows:&mdash;(1)
names taken from the vegetable kingdom, 18 in number;
(2) from the animal kingdom, 9; (3) from natural phenomena
in general, 17; (4) from periodically recurring actions, 10; (5)
from customs and festivals, 25; in addition to which there are
a few unexplained and three Latin names. Since it is my
purpose to give an idea not only of the variety of the names
but also of the fluctuating relationship with the Julian months,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
I arrange the material of Miklosich’s first four groups according
to the months, omitting isolated and uncertain names. If the
statement as to the corresponding Julian month in Miklosich
is not clear, I add a mark of interrogation. I am also indebted
to Prof. G. Kazarow of Sofia for detailed information
as to the Bulgarian names of months, and for extracts from
the Bulgarian work of Kovatschev on popular astronomy and
meteorology; these sources are referred to respectively as Kaz.
and Kov. An asterisk prefixed to the name of a month means
that the same name is given to another month also; if prefixed
to the abbreviation denoting the country, the asterisk
shews that the name is given to two different months in that
country. The names refer to:&mdash;1, <em>January</em>, *‘month of clods’,
Czech, since the hard frost turns the earth into clods; ‘ice
month’, Czech; *‘increasing of the day-light’, Old Bulg., Slovak,
Croat.; ‘cold month’, Pol., Bulg.; *‘the Cutter’, Slovak, Bulg.,
Serb., which Miklosich rightly refers to the felling of trees, Yermoloff
and others less well to the piercing cold; ‘the Great

*‘cherry month’, Serb., *Bulg. (Kov., cf. the Albanian July);
‘month of ears’, Slovak; *‘linden month’, Slovak, Serb., since
the linden blossoms then; *‘rose-blossoming month’, Low Sorb.,

rutting of the deer, <i>zarev</i>), Old Bulg.; ‘time when people are

Bulg. (Kov.); *‘heath-plant month’, Old Bulg., Pol., Ruthen.,
(Czech, July or August); *‘time when the goats rut’, *Slovak;

Old Bulg., Serb., Bulg., Old Russ., Czech (earlier); ‘gathering
of the clusters’, Bulg.; ‘month of the (winter-)sowing’, Ruthen.;
‘old women’s summer’, Ruthen., Pol. (?); ‘autumn’, Russ., Slovak.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
10, <em>October</em>, *‘leaf-fall’, Old Bulg., Serb., *Bulg. (Kaz.); ‘the
yellow (month)’, Ruthen.; *‘time when the goat ruts’, *Slovak;
*‘month of the lowing’ (<i>řijen</i>), Czech (present day); ‘time of flax-preparing’

Czech; ‘month of the snow-storm’, Ruthen.; ‘winter month’,
Bulg. (Kov.); *‘kindling of the wheel’, *Bulg. (Kov., see above).
More rarely the festivals give their names to the months. This
is the case with Christmas, Candlemas, All Saints’ Day, the
festival of the birth of the Virgin, and the feast of the Rosalia
(= Whitsun), Slovak, Bulg. (Kaz.), and with 14 saints’ days,
e. g. <i>Martinzi</i>, November, Bulg. (Kov.). With regard to Bulg.
<i>gorêštnik</i> (= July) Kazarow writes to me: “<i>gorêšt</i> = ‘hot’; in
July the people celebrate a fire-festival of three days’ duration,
viz. the 15th, 16th, and 17th of July, <i>gorêštnici</i>”. Of the Latin
names of months only three have been borrowed:&mdash;<em>May</em>
(common), Slovak, Croat., Ruthen., Russ., Czech, Pol., Sorb.;
more rarely <em>April</em>, Old Bulg., Sorb.; and <em>March</em>, Croat., Serb.,
Ruthen., Pol., High Sorb.</p>

<p>The great majority of the names refer to natural phenomena
and country occupations. The variety of the series need
not be specially pointed out, the numerous asterisks shew the
fluctuation and variation of the nomenclature between two or even
three months. Much is explained, as is indicated by the mention
of the countries in which the names originate, by the extremely
various climatic conditions prevailing in the countries
occupied by the Slavs, and a further explanation of the variety
is to be sought in the well-known phenomenon that when the
seasons correspond only imperfectly with the months, the equalisation
is carried out sometimes with one month, sometimes
with another. It must be so, since among the same people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
the same name describes various months. Pairs of months
are however rare: ‘the big’ and ‘the little’ <i>sêčko</i> (January and
February), Bulg.; ‘the little grass-month’ (March) and the ‘big’
one (April or May), Slovak; the little and big ‘cochineal’
months (June and July), Czech, distinguished in the calendar
of to-day as <i>červen</i> and <i>červenec</i> (diminutive), so that the
names have changed places; and <i>žătvar</i>, ‘reaper’ (July) and
<i>žătvarskijat</i>, ‘harvest-month’ (August), Bulgarian (Kazarow).
Here also must be placed <i>zarev</i> and cognates, Old Bulg.,
Russ., Czech, which is inchoative and means ‘beginning of the
lowing (the rutting)’, and <i>rjujin</i> and cognates, Old Bulg., Slovak,
Serb., Old Russian, Czech, ‘the lowing’, i. e. the full rutting
and therefore the second rutting-month. The character
of all these names is only too obvious. Hence the fact that
the word for month is very rarely added, though it appears
in the translation. These names have proved so vigorous that
in Czech and Polish they have ousted the Latin names (with
the exception of May).</p>

<p>In the same way I give a summary of the German
names of months, from the abundant compilations more particularly
of Weinhold and Ebner. Here too I make no claim
to completeness,&mdash;some names have been deliberately omitted&mdash;my
purpose being only to give an idea of the variety and
instability of the names. To this end I choose the forms which
are most easily intelligible.</p>

<p>1, <em>January</em>:&mdash;bare month (the bare, naked month), *hard
month, *winter month, ice month, *wolf month, threshing month,
month of calves, ‘Great Horn’, *<i>Volborn</i>, <i>Lasmaend</i>, <i>Laumonat</i>
(the last three unexplained). 2, <em>February</em>:&mdash;last winter month,
wood month, fox month, ‘Little Horn’, <i>Hornung</i>, *<i>Volborn</i>,
<i>Rebmaend</i>, <i>Redmaend</i>, <i>Selle(maend)</i>, <i>Sporkel</i>, <i>Sprokkelmaend</i>.
3, <em>March</em>:&mdash;(first) ploughing month, drying month, *spring
month, sowing month, pruning month, vernal month, spring.
4, <em>April</em>:&mdash;second ploughing month, *spring month, grass month,
shepherds’ month, cuckoo month, the rough month (<i>Rûmaend</i>).
5, <em>May</em>:&mdash;ass month, month of joy, month of flowers, bean month.
6, <em>June</em>:&mdash;fallow month, *dog month, rose month, pasture month,

‘cochineal’), summer month, fallow. 7, <em>July</em>:&mdash;(first) *<i>Augst</i>,

<i>Bîsmaend</i> (when the cattle, tormented by the heat and the
flies, run about (<i>biset</i>) the fields as if mad), *<i>Arne</i>, *cutting.
9, <em>September</em>:&mdash;second <i>Augst</i>, <i>Augstin</i>, cutting of oats, (*first)
*autumn month, *sowing month, spelt month, barley month,
boar month, *<i>Fulmaend</i>, <i>Laeset</i>, <i>Hanfluchet</i>, bean-harvest, first

*second) *autumn month, first winter month, *sowing month,
*slaughtering month, *<i>Folmaend</i>, <i>Aarzelmaend</i> (since the year turns
back), (second) autumn, *<i>Laupreisi</i> (leaf-fall). 11, <em>November</em>:&mdash;(*second
or third) *autumn month, *winter month, <i>Laubryszmaend</i>,
leaf month, month of rime, month of winds, month of dirt, *hard
month, *slaughtering month, <i>Smeermaend</i>, *full month, *wolf

month, (second) *winter month, *hard month, *slaughtering
month, month of bacon, *wolf month, hare month, second winter.
There are also many names borrowed from feasts and
saints’ days, such as (New) Year month and the synonymous
<i>Kalemaend</i> = Calends month (January), <i>Fassnachtmaend</i> or <i>Olle
Wiwermaend</i> (February), <i>Klibelmaend</i> (Conception of the Virgin,
March), Holy Month or Christ Month. The Latin names March,
April, May, and August have also become very popular; the
last-named has for special reasons been included in the
above list<a id="FNanchor_995" href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a>.</p>

<p>The history of the German names of months has been
elucidated by Weinhold and for the Alemannic district by the
work of Ebner, who bases his researches upon extensive information<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
collected among the people. As early as the time
of Charlemagne a German series of months had been created
in order to bring the Julian months more closely home to the
people, so that the list was based largely upon a popular
foundation. The names are:&mdash;<i>Wintarmânoth</i>, <i>Hornunc</i>, <i>Lenzinm.</i>,
<i>Ostarm.</i>, <i>Wunnim.</i>, <i>Brâchm.</i>, <i>Hewim.</i>, <i>Aranm.</i>, <i>Witum.</i>,
<i>Windumem.</i>, <i>Herbistm.</i>, <i>Heilagm.</i> This series attained great
influence, but did not become universal; on the contrary it
was subjected to alteration under the pressure of the agricultural
terms. In spite of this early attempt at unity the German
names for the months shew once more the variety and
fluctuation with which the reader is now sufficiently familiar.
A special interest attaches to the fact that the sources make
it possible to follow how the names of months arise from the
simple terms for the seasons. On this point Weinhold says,
p. 2:&mdash;“In our sources the general statement <i>in der erne</i>
(‘in the harvest’) preponderates over the month-name <i>ernemanot</i>
(‘harvest-month’); <i>im brâchet</i> (‘in the fallow’), <i>im höuwet</i> (‘in
the hay-harvest’) hold their own alongside of <i>brâch-</i> and <i>höu-monat</i>
(‘fallow-, hay-month’), <i>im wimmot</i> (‘in the vintage’) persists,
since <i>windumemânot</i> (‘vintage-month’) had long since died out.
From the phrases <i>in der sât</i>, <i>in dem snite</i> (‘in the sowing’, ‘in
the cutting’) are painfully evolved a <i>sâtmân</i> and a <i>schnitmonat</i>
(‘sowing-, cutting-month’). We find autumn and winter as
names of months, and also the non-German <i>augst</i>, divided into
three; we can see the uncertainty with which <i>laubbrost</i> and
<i>laubrîse</i> (‘sprouting and falling of the leaves’) contract into
names of months.” Accordingly the above list shews that
alongside the names compounded with ‘month’ the simple terms
from seasons and occupations of the year are frequently found
as names for the months. March = <i>Lenz</i> (spring), June = <i>Brachet</i>
(fallow), July = <i>Heuet</i> (hay-harvest), August = <i>Arne</i> (harvest),
September = <i>Bonenarve</i>, <i>Hanfluchet</i>, <i>erst Herbst</i>, <i>Herbstsaat</i>,
<i>Überherbst</i>, <i>Laeset</i> (<i>Lesezeit</i>) (bean-harvest, hemp-gathering,
first autumn, autumn-sowing, late autumn, harvest time),
October = <i>ander Herbst</i>, <i>Herbst</i>, <i>Laupreisi</i> (second autumn,
autumn, leaf-fall), December = <i>ander Winter</i>. Of great significance
is the state of affairs found in the Alemannic sources<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
of the 14th century<a id="FNanchor_996" href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a>; side by side with the compound forms
the simple often appear, but always as definite names of
months. Towards the end of the century they then begin to
have a loose connexion with the conception ‘month’, e. g.
<i>brachot der manod</i> (‘fallow the month’). This shews the method
by which these names have become names of months, and
Ebner judges the process quite correctly when he says that
the definite names of months were only secondarily evolved
from the general time-indications. He adds:&mdash;“This observation
can often be made in the sources, viz. that alongside
of the month-name which exactly circumscribes a lunar period
(<em>sic!</em>, must be ‘a Julian month’) a simple conception of time
also appears. These simple terms, such as ‘autumn’ for September,
also appear as general time-indications, especially in
the old laws. They originally have this character, and they
shew it even to-day. Little by little they become stereotyped
into fixed names of months, and enter into association with the
conception ‘month’. In this sense as definite names of months
the simple terms live for a long time in the sources alongside
of the full terms (those with ‘month’), but in the end lose their
force as definite names of months; to-day they are in dialects
general time-indications”<a id="FNanchor_997" href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a>. There is therefore an attempt to
render popular the unfamiliar Julian divisions of the year by
giving them popularly intelligible names; Charlemagne by his
series of months had already tried to systematise the process.
The same phenomenon shews itself in the single fragment of
a Gothic calendar which has come down to us, where November
is equated to <i>fruma jiuleis</i>.</p>

<p>The fact that the people regarded the months as seasons,
and did not clearly distinguish them from the latter as divisions
of time with a definite number of days, has sympathetically
affected those Latin names which became really popular.
When we hear of a ‘first’ and a ‘second’ May, the name is
evidently loosely regarded as a general term for the early
summer. <i>Augst</i> comes to mean simply ‘harvest’<a id="FNanchor_998" href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a>; hence July
is called ‘the first <i>Augst</i>’ and August ‘the second <i>Augst</i>’, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
the latter is named <i>Augst</i> and September is called <i>Ander
Augst</i>, <i>Augstin</i>, or <i>Haberaugst</i> (oat-harvest).</p>

<p>This explanation is opposed by the statement of Tille
that in primitive Germanic times there were sixty-day divisions<a id="FNanchor_999" href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a>
from which the pairs of months have arisen, and that
the fluctuation in the names of months is due to the fact that
these divisions of time began in the middle of the Julian month<a id="FNanchor_1000" href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a>.
The fluctuation in the names of months is shewn by the frequent
asterisks in the above list, and the pairs of months are:&mdash;big
and little <i>Horn</i><a id="FNanchor_1001" href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a>, the first and second ploughing month,
the first and second May, the first and second <i>Augst</i>, or <i>Augst</i>
and <i>Augstin</i> or <i>Haberaugst</i>, and first and second autumn.
Our researches ought to make a special refutation of Tille’s
thesis unnecessary. Obviously the seasons never had a definite
number of days before they became names of months;
both phenomena find their explanation in the indeterminate
length and position of the seasons upon which the scheme of
the Julian months was superimposed. Accordingly, where
the name of the month was taken from a longer season, the
people counted three or four months with the same name.
Thus October and November are called respectively third and
last autumn month, December is fourth autumn month, February
third or last winter month.</p>

<p>The German names of months were in great measure
genuinely popular,&mdash;their very multiplicity, which has its
roots in the life of the people, suffices to prove that&mdash;but
they have had to give way to the Latin names in spite of the
attempts made in modern times in the popular calendars, and
especially under the influence of Romanticism, to establish
them throughout. In our own day they persist in popular
usage chiefly in Switzerland.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon months are preserved in a well-known
passage of Bede<a id="FNanchor_1002" href="#Footnote_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a>. I give each name with the explanation.
1, <i>giuli</i>; 2, <i>solmonað</i>: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mensis placentarum, quas in eo diis suis
offerebant</i>; 3, <i>hreðmonað</i>: <i>a dea illorum Hreða</i>; 4, <i>eosturm.</i>:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a dea illorum, quae Eostre vocabatur</i>; 5, <i>þrimilci</i>: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quod tribus
vicibus in eo per diem pecora mulgebantur</i>; 6, <i>liða</i>; 7, <i>liða</i>:
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">blandus sive navigabilis</i>; 8, <i>weodm.</i>: <i>mensis zizaniorum</i> (‘weeds’),
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quod ea tempestate maxime abundent</i>; 9, <i>halegm.</i>: <i>mensis sacrorum</i>;
10, <i>wintirfyllið</i>: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">composito novo nonune hiemeplenilunium</i>;
11, <i>blotm.</i>: <i>mensis immolationum</i>; 12, <i>giuli</i>: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a conversione solis
in auctum diei</i>. Of the explanations of Bede some are obvious,
others doubtful. For instance one would rather connect February
with the word <i>sol</i> = ‘sun’, or perhaps with <i>sol</i> = ‘dirt’
(on account of the melting of the snow), since no word <i>sol</i> =
‘cake’ is known. The goddesses Hreða and Eostre, who formerly
played a great part in mythological discussions, are now
with reason suspected as being an explanation of Bede’s.
<i>Hreðmonað</i> is ‘the rough month’<a id="FNanchor_1003" href="#Footnote_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a>, <i>hreðness</i> is ‘roughness’,
especially of the weather; the name is therefore equivalent
to the second term for the same month, <i>hlyda</i> (see below).
In the case of <i>eostur</i> one might think of some lost
name of a season which, like <i>giuli</i>, was transferred to a Christian
festival. For <i>halegmonað</i> and <i>wintirfyllið</i> see below; <i>blotmonað</i>
is the slaughtering month; the explanation of <i>giuli</i> is fatally
wrong.</p>

<p>A calendar in Bibl. Cottoniensis, assigned by Hickes to
the year 1031, has the same names, but unfortunately, on
account of damage caused by the great fire, nos. 1, 7, 9, and
12 are missing<a id="FNanchor_1004" href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a>. The <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Menologium Poeticum</cite><a id="FNanchor_1005" href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> does not translate
all the names. The series is:&mdash;Januarius, Februarius or <i>solmonað</i>,
Martius or <i>hlyda</i>, <i>Aprelis monað</i>, Maius, Junius or <i>ærra
liða</i>, <i>Julius monað</i>, Augustus or <i>weodmonað</i>, September or <i>haligmonað</i>,
October or <i>winterfylleð</i>, November or <i>blotmonað</i>, December
or <i>ærra jula</i>. There are missing therefore, probably
not by accident, <i>eostermonað</i> and the second month of each of
the pairs. Finally I give the list compiled by Hickes:&mdash;1,

<i>maiusm.</i>; 6, <i>serem.</i>, <i>midsumorm.</i>, <i>ærra liða</i>, <i>Juniusm.</i>; 7, <i>meðm.,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>

<i>blotm.</i>; 12, <i>midvinterm.</i>, <i>ærre geola</i><a id="FNanchor_1006" href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a>. Of these variants upon
Bede’s list <i>harvestm.</i>, <i>hærfestm</i>. occurs frequently and indeed is
attested from the year 1000. In Robert of Gloucester (1297 A. D.)
the word means August<a id="FNanchor_1007" href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a>. The two others are doubtful: they
appear in the first edition of Bosworth’s Anglo-Saxon Dictionary,
which Weinhold used, but are absent in the second,
doubtless because the sources are unknown. As far as I can
see they come from Hickes, they are missing in Hampson’s
Glossary. The Oxford Dictionary says, s. v. <i>meadmonth</i>: “an
alleged O. E. name for July”. Of <i>seremonth</i> it gives a late
example, where the word is equivalent to August<a id="FNanchor_1008" href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a>. It is possible
that Hickes used sources which have perished in the fire
at the Bibliotheca Cottoniensis. The form <i>searmonað</i>, so far
as I know, appears only in Bosworth, and is perhaps a normalising
of the spelling. The name ‘dry month’ (mod. Eng. ‘sear’,
‘sere’) corresponds as badly as possible to June, and is not
much more suitable for August. A satisfactory explanation
would be given if, as Prof. Ekwall proposes to me, we assume
that <i>seremonað</i> = <i>sceremonað</i>, <em>s</em> being often written for <em>sc</em>
from the 12th century onwards; the name would then mean
‘sheep-shearing month’. Fluctuation in the names of months is
seen here also: <i>haligmonað</i> means September or October,
<i>harvest-monað</i> both August and September. So far the Anglo-Saxon
months present the usual characteristics in the nomenclature,
and in the fluctuation of the names. A point worthy of
note is the agreement in name with the Gothic <i>fruma jiuleis</i>
but difference in position: this is explained by the fact that
<i>jiuleis</i>, <i>giuli</i>, <i>jul</i> is an old word for a shorter season.</p>

<p>Bede’s further statements as to the Anglo-Saxon year are
very important and have been much disputed. He represents
it as a lunisolar year with lunar months. It began on Dec.
25th; this night the heathens called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modra nect, id est matrum
noctem ob causam, ut suspicamur, ceremoniarum quas in ea
pervigiles agebant</i> (“that is the night of the mothers, because,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
as we suppose, of some ceremonies which they performed in
the night”). In an ordinary year each season had three months,
in leap-year the thirteenth month was intercalated in the summer,
it was a third <i>liða</i> and a year of this kind was called
<i>annus thri-lidi</i>. Further, the year was divided into two halves,
winter and summer, of six months each, and winter began with
the month <i>wintirfyllið</i>. Here and here alone have we an
account of a heathen Germanic lunisolar year. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A priori</i> such
an account contains nothing surprising. Tacitus, <cite>Germ.</cite> XI, had
already stated that the Germans observed the lunar month.
The question is whether they also named the months and arrived
at a fixed series, whereby the empirical intercalation of a
month would arise of itself. In the last centuries of heathen
times they were certainly not at a lower stage of civilisation
than many other peoples in various parts of the world among
whom this form of year did arise, but the trustworthiness of
the report is far from being established by this general consideration.</p>

<p>Bilfinger has subjected the account to severe criticism,
and on internal evidence states it to be a construction of Bede’s<a id="FNanchor_1009" href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a>.
The account, he says, fluctuates between the solar and the
lunar year; for instance Bede says in one place that the year
begins on December 25th, and in another that winter begins
with the lunar month <i>wintirfyllið</i>. But this is done in any
description of a lunisolar year that does not choose expressions
with pedantic accuracy. Even in modern scientific
handbooks we read e. g. that the Attic year began with the
summer solstice, which is an abbreviated and incorrect expression
for ‘at the first new moon after the summer solstice’.
The learned chronologist, Bede, has, according to Bilfinger,
elaborated his system upon the following points of departure:
the derivation of the word ‘month’ from ‘moon’, the phrase
<i>annus thri-lidi</i>, which really means ‘a year so favourable
that three sea-voyages can be made in it’, and the beginning
of the year on Dec. 25th, which is assumed by Bilfinger to
be the ecclesiastical beginning of the year on Christmas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
Day, at that time used in England. The Anglo-Saxon names
of months, he concludes, are accordingly nothing more than
native terms for the Julian months, and therefore first became
names of months on the introduction of the Roman calendar.
The criticism is acute, but is not without its weak points. Bede
knew quite well that the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mensis</i> is connected with <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μήν</span>
and properly means lunar month, and had a very good knowledge
of matters chronological; why then should he claim lunar
months for the Anglo-Saxons if to his knowledge only solar
months existed among them? In regard to the explanation of
<i>thri-lidi</i> we require to know from documents that two sea-voyages
were usually made in summer, and what was the goal
of these voyages that there should be only two of them.
Such evidence is not forthcoming. And further, as Prof. Ekwall
informs me, Bilfinger’s explanation is linguistically improbable.
Such a formation would presuppose a word *<i>līð</i>,
‘journey’, and no such word exists; on the other hand <i>þriliði</i>,
‘with three <i>liða</i>’, is perfectly regular<a id="FNanchor_1010" href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a>. Further ‘the holy month’,
<i>halegmonað</i>, cannot be explained by Christian influence, since
there is no great Christian festival in September: the origin
must be sought in the heathen cult, but is obscure. It is not
improbable that the festival of harvest was intended. However
this carries the name back to pre-Christian times. <i>Wintirfyllið</i>
means, according to Bede, ‘(first) full moon of the winter’.
With this is connected Gothic <i>fulliþ</i>, translated by ‘full moon’<a id="FNanchor_1011" href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a>.
By this parallel the lunar character of this month is also
proved. In opposition to Bilfinger’s theory it therefore appears
that there are a couple of facts, arising out of the months
themselves, which point to the heathen origin and lunar character
of the months.</p>

<p>The difficulties lie elsewhere. The beginning of the year
is according to Bede Dec. 25. But where a fixed series of
twelve months exists, with a fixed intercalary month, it lies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
in the nature of things that the month which is doubled in the
intercalation should be the beginning of the year, since this
month is regulated by a fixed point or season of the year; the
month in question is in this case <i>liða</i>, in summer. Now the
beginning of the year in the sense mentioned <a href="#Page_276">above, p. 276</a>,
does not necessarily coincide with the beginning of the series
of months. The beginning of the year in this case, however,
is on Bede’s own testimony the beginning of winter, as among
the Scandinavians. We are therefore driven to the conclusion
that Bede erroneously substituted the ecclesiastical beginning
of the year at the Christmas festival, and that the cause of
his error was the fact that at this time the heathen Anglo-Saxons
celebrated a Feast of the Mothers, which corresponded
to the Scandinavian Yule festival celebrated at the same time
of the year; whereas in reality the Anglo-Saxons, like most
peoples, had no sharply defined beginning of the year.</p>

<p>Although, therefore, Bede’s account presents great difficulties,
they are not diminished by the assumption that the
scheme is a construction of his own. In my opinion there is
no denying the trustworthiness of the account or the probability
that the heathen Anglo-Saxons had arrived at a fixed
series of months with empirical intercalation in the summer.
But even if this was so, the case is isolated, and does not
advance our knowledge of the form of the year among the
other Germanic peoples. This only may be pointed out, that
the Icelanders inserted their intercalary week in the summer
just as the Anglo-Saxons, according to Bede, did with their
intercalary month. But since the form of the year is so entirely
different in each case, this agreement cannot be made to
support further conclusions, any more than the two cases of
agreement with the Gothic calendar.</p>

<p>The Icelandic months, in conformity with the peculiar
arrangement of the year, do not coincide with the Julian, but
begin either shortly before or in the middle of these. The
series is:&mdash;1, <i>þorri</i>; 2, <i>Goi</i>; 3, <i>Einmánaðr</i>, because one month
is left before the beginning of summer; 4, <i>Gaukmánaðr</i> (cuckoo
month) or <i>Sáðtið</i> (seed-time) or <i>Harpa</i> (unexplained); 5, <i>Eggtið</i>
or <i>Stekktið</i> or <i>Skerpla</i> (unexplained); 6, <i>Sólmánaðr</i> (sun month)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
or <i>Selmánaðr</i> (cowherd’s hut month); 7, <i>Miðsummar</i>, or <i>Heyannir</i>
(hay-time); 8, <i>Tvímánaðr</i>, since two months are left to
the beginning of winter, or <i>Kornskurðmánaðr</i> (barley-cutting
month); 9, <i>Haustmánaðr</i>; 10, <i>Gormánaðr</i> (slaughtering month,
<i>gor</i> is the refuse thrown away in the slaughtering); 11, <i>Frermánaðr</i>
(frost-month) or <i>Ylir</i> (cognate with <i>Yul</i>); 12, <i>Jólmánaðr</i>
(Yule-month) or <i>Hrútmánaðr</i> (ram month, on account of the
pairing of the sheep) or <i>Mörsugr</i> (‘the fat-sucker’)<a id="FNanchor_1012" href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a>. Some of
these names are also used to describe seasons and have been
explained <a href="#Page_74">above, p. 74</a>. With the exception of <i>þorri</i>, <i>Goi</i>,
and <i>Einmánaðr</i>, however, these months are not used in practical
life, where the reckoning is performed in weeks. In modern
times the Icelandic months have other names but keep
the same position in the year:&mdash;1, <i>Miðsvetrarm</i>. (midwinter
month); 2, <i>Föstu(in)gangsm</i>. (beginning of fasting); 3, <i>Jafnðøgram</i>.
(month of the equinox); 4, <i>Sumarm</i>. (beginning of summer);
5, <i>Farðagam</i>. (because it is the legal time for moving);
6, <i>Nottleysum</i>. (the nightless month); 7, <i>Stuttnættism</i>. (month of
the short nights) or <i>Maðkam</i>. (as in Denmark, month of worms);
8, <i>Heyannam</i>. (month of the hay-time); 9, <i>Addrattam</i>. (<i>m. necessitatum
apportandarum</i>); 10, <i>Slatrunarm</i>. (slaughtering
month), older <i>Garðlagsm</i>. (<i>m. sæpium struendarum</i>); 11, <i>Riðtíðarm</i>.
(spawning month); 12, <i>Skamdegism</i>. (month of the
short days) or <i>Jólam</i><a id="FNanchor_1013" href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a>.</p>

<p>In Norway, according to Finn Magnusson<a id="FNanchor_1014" href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a>, January is
sometimes called <i>Thorre</i>, February sometimes <i>Thorre</i>, now
and again also <i>Gjö</i>, March sometimes <i>Gjö</i>, here and there also
<i>Krikla</i>, June <i>Gro</i> (sprouting month); I shall return <a href="#Page_302">below, p. 302</a>,
to the explanation of the variation. Weinhold gives a complete
list:&mdash;1, <i>Torre</i>; 2, <i>Gjö</i>; 3, <i>Krikla</i> or <i>Kvine</i>; 4 and 5, <i>Voarmoanar</i>;
6 and 7, <i>Sumarmoanar</i>; 8 and 9, <i>Haustmoanar</i>; 10
and 11, <i>Vinterstid</i>; 12, <i>Jolemoane</i> or <i>Skammtid</i> (time of the
short days)<a id="FNanchor_1015" href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a>.</p>

<p>Of the Danish months the learned Olaus Worm in the
17th century gives two series<a id="FNanchor_1016" href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a>. The months of the first series<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
are lunar months, he says, and begin with the first new moon
of the new year:&mdash;1, <i>Diur Rey</i> or <i>Renden</i>, on account of
the pairing of the animals (<i>at løbe i Rhed</i>); 2, <i>Thormaen</i>;
3, <i>Faremaen</i>, on account of the journeys; 4, <i>Maymaen</i>; 5,
<i>Sommermaen</i>; 6, <i>Ormemaen</i> (month of worms); 7, <i>Hoemaen</i>
(hay month); 8, <i>Kornmaen</i>; 9, <i>Fiskemaen</i>; 10, <i>Sædemaen</i> (seed
month); 11, <i>Pølsemaen</i> (sausage month); 12, <i>Julemaen</i>. The
intercalary month is called <i>Sildemaen</i>, ‘the late month’. The
Julian months are called:&mdash;1, <i>Glugmanet</i>; 2, <i>Blidem.</i> (the
mild month); 3, <i>Torm.</i>; 4, <i>Farem.</i>; 5, <i>Maym.</i>; 6, <i>Skærsommer</i>;
7, <i>Ormem.</i>; 8, <i>Høstm.</i>; 9, <i>Fiskem.</i>; 10, <i>Sædem.</i>; 11, <i>Slagtem.</i>;
12, <i>Christm.</i> The northern Danes and the inhabitants of Skåne
are said to call the first four months: 1, <i>Glug</i>, 2, <i>Gøje</i>, 3,
<i>Thor</i>, 4, <i>Blidel</i>. <i>Blidel</i> was until our own time in popular
use in southern Skåne, but it denoted February and in this
position it appears in Hickes<a id="FNanchor_1017" href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a>. The same series is found in
Finn Magnusson<a id="FNanchor_1018" href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a>, but with certain variants:&mdash;1, <i>Ism</i>. (ice
month); 2, <i>Dyrem.</i>; 4, <i>Faarem.</i> (sheep month); 6, <i>Sommerm.</i>;
7, <i>Madkem.</i>; 8, <i>Høm.</i>; 10, <i>Ridem.</i> (riding month); 11, <i>Vinterm.</i>;
12, <i>Julem.</i><a id="FNanchor_1019" href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a>. Feilberg in his well-known Dictionary of the popular
speech of Jylland gives some characteristic modern popular
names. <i>Helmisse</i> (‘holy mass’) really means All Souls’
Day, and then an old worn-out horse, whose last strength is
exhausted in the autumn ploughing and who dies in consequence;
hence September or October obtains the name <i>helmissemåned</i>.
March is called <i>kattemåned</i>, from the pairing of
the cats, or <i>prangermåned</i> (<i>pranger</i> = ‘dealer’), because most
business is transacted then. These are evidently more in the
nature of by-names, but it is precisely names of this sort that
oust the Latin names, since they are intelligible.</p>

<p>In the Swedish almanac, until it was modernised in the
year 1901, Swedish names stood beside the Latin. They ran:&mdash;<i>Torsmånad</i>,
<i>Göjem.</i>, <i>Vårm.</i> (spring month), <i>Gräsm.</i> (grass
month), <i>Blomsterm.</i> (month of flowers), <i>Sommarm.</i>, <i>Höm.</i>
(hay month), <i>Skördem.</i> (harvest month), <i>Höstm.</i> (autumn month),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
<i>Slaktm.</i> (slaughtering month), <i>Vinterm.</i>, <i>Julm.</i> It is true that
these names were never used. The series has arisen from an
older one which is first attested for the year 1538. In the
latter three months have Latin names, <i>Marsmånad</i>, <i>Aprilmånad</i>,
<i>Majmånad</i>, October is named <i>Winmånad</i> (vine-month),
December <i>Christmånad</i>. These names shew that the series is
of German origin; in Sweden vines are not cultivated, and
December 24th is never called Christmas Eve but Yule Eve.
The list agrees with one given by Weinhold, p. 8, which as
early as the 15th century was common to all Germany, and
the agreement is shewn also in this point that, as is often the
case in German lists, the months 3, 4, and 5 retain their Latin
names. When it is further remembered that <i>Augst</i> means
‘harvest’, the variations will be seen to consist only in the
substitution of the old names <i>Tor</i> and <i>Göje</i> for <i>Jenner</i> and
<i>Hornung</i> and the renaming of ‘the fallow month’ (<i>Brachmonat</i>)
from midsummer, which is in Sweden a great popular festival.
The more suitable <i>Slakt-</i> and <i>Julmånad</i> were substituted for
<i>Win-</i> and <i>Christmånad</i> in 1608 by the almanac-maker Forsius:
the three Latin names were first exchanged for Swedish in
1734 by the almanac-maker Hiorter<a id="FNanchor_1020" href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a>. There is moreover one
Swedish name which is still very popular and which falls
outside the usual series, viz. <i>rötmånaden</i> (‘the rotten month’),
so named because it falls in the most sultry time of the summer,
when it is very difficult to keep meat and other food from
going bad. It is fixed at the time in which the sun stands in
Leo (July 22-Aug. 23; about July 13-Aug. 14, old style).
Formerly it was known as ‘the Dog-days’,&mdash;a translation
of <i>dies caniculares</i>&mdash;and the position varied considerably.
The period descends from the period of the Etesian in the
ancient Greek calendar, and it was not till the 17th century
that it was generally equated to the time during which the
sun stands in Leo<a id="FNanchor_1021" href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a>.</p>

<p>The Swedish list of months is therefore largely of foreign
or learned origin. The only popular names are <i>Tor</i> and <i>Göje</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
which also often occur without the addition of ‘month’. The
Icelanders have made Thorri and Goi into mythological figures<a id="FNanchor_1022" href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a>.
In Sweden the people have personified these names. When it
snows, Goja shakes her robe. Thor (= March), with the long
beard, entices the children outside the wall, they say in the
north of Skåne,&mdash;in the south the same thing is said of <i>Bliel</i>
(<i>Blidel</i> = February)&mdash;and then <i>Far Fäjeskinn</i> (= April) comes
and drives them in again. The latter month is conceived of
as ‘Father Sweep-skin’: but it is possible that in <i>far</i> the month-name
<i>Fare-maaned</i> (= April) appears. In Norway the names
of the same three months&mdash;<i>Thorre</i>, <i>Gjö</i>, and <i>Krikla</i>&mdash;were
the only ones in common use, and so in Iceland, <i>þorri</i>, <i>Goi</i>,
and <i>Einmánaðr</i>. The beginning of these three months was
hailed with popular celebrations both in Iceland and elsewhere
in Scandinavia<a id="FNanchor_1023" href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a>. And now attempts have been made to
prove that these Norwegian months are old lunar months. In
Aasen’s Norwegian Dictionary it is stated that the country
people even to-day still count and name the moons, so that
e. g. the moon which is in the heavens during the Yuletide-festival
is termed the Yule moon if it continues until the end
of the festival, the day of Epiphany: and if it does not last till
the end of this period, then the next following moon is the
Yule moon, i. e. the Yule moon is in reality the moon which
is in the heavens on the day of Epiphany. The terms and
the calculation of the following moons are regulated accordingly.
Certainly the heathen Germans must have been acquainted
with the lunar month, and the existence of the lunisolar calendar
among the Anglo-Saxons is not to be denied, but in this
case we must unreservedly agree with Bilfinger<a id="FNanchor_1024" href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a> that this lunar
reckoning is of Christian origin. Then in order to fix the date
of the important movable festivals the most convenient practical
means was to begin from the first new moon after the day of
Epiphany, i. e. after the Yule moon. The old rule says:&mdash;“Count
the moon which is in the sky on the day of Epiphany
as long as it lasts, and then ten days onward from the new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
moon, and you have the <i>terminus Septuagesimæ</i>.” Hence is
derived the Swedish peasant rule:&mdash;“The moon which is in
the sky at the day of Epiphany shall be the Christmas moon,
whether it be young or old.” After this follows the <i>disting</i>-moon<a id="FNanchor_1025" href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a>.
On account of the ecclesiastically prescribed period
of Lent and the Easter festival it was absolutely necessary to
be able to calculate this time, and the calculation was most
simply performed in the fashion just described, although the
phenomena of the heavens did not exactly agree with the rule
of computation. The third of these moons was followed by the
Easter festival. For this reason these three months have stamped
themselves upon the minds of the people in all the Scandinavian
countries. It is because they are lunar months, and
not because they began, like the Icelandic months, in the middle
of the Julian months, that the relationship of the first three
Norwegian names of months to the Julian varies in the manner
shewn <a href="#Page_298">above, p. 298</a>. A further question, however, is the age
of the names <i>þorri</i> (<i>Tor</i>) and <i>Göje</i>. Since in spite of many
ingenious attempts these words remain etymologically unexplained,
and moreover are not borrowed, the names must
originate in an older period. What they meant before they
received their present application we do not know, but there
is nothing to shew that they are not old names of months.
There is a possibility, certainly somewhat remote, that their
use as names of months is pre-Christian, although the computation
is Christian. There would be nothing surprising in this,
if it were the case, since the Germans were acquainted with
lunar months, and they had attained a much higher stage of
civilisation than many peoples who were familiar with the
lunisolar year as regulated by empirical intercalation.</p>

<p>A sure indication of an Old Swedish heathen reckoning
in lunar months has been acutely pointed out by Beckman<a id="FNanchor_1026" href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a> in
the rule, attested from the time of the Reformation, for fixing
the date of the fair at Uppsala known as the <i>disting</i>, which is
a direct continuation of the great sacrificial festival at the
heathen temple in Uppsala, the <i>disablot</i>. The rule, as has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
already been indicated (p. 302), says that the <i>disting</i> shall be held
at the full of the moon following the Epiphany moon, and therefore
exactly two months before the Easter full moon. This
rule certainly goes back to ancient times and cannot arise
from the Christian computation of Easter, since there would be
no reason for arranging with reference to Easter the date
of a fair so long before Easter and originating in heathen
times<a id="FNanchor_1027" href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a>. Rather is the explanation given in the words of Tacitus,
that the Germans held their assemblies at new or full
moon, which would also apply to the great sacrificial festival
and the popular assembly of the Svear. This however
presupposes that the insertion of the intercalary month was
fixed in some way, so that no error might arise in regard to
the moon of the <i>disting</i>. After Christianity was introduced,
and with it the computation of the three moons before Easter,
the computation of the <i>disting</i>-moon was also modified in
accordance with these. A statement of Snorre<a id="FNanchor_1028" href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a> however causes
difficulty. Snorre says that the <i>disablot</i> was celebrated in <i>Goe</i>,
but that after the introduction of Christianity the date of the
fair was altered to Candlemas (Feb. 2). The latter statement
contradicts the rule, and is ingeniously explained by Beckman.
In the year 1219, when Snorre was staying in Sweden, the
full moon of the <i>disting</i> fell on the first of February, and
Snorre has generalised the single case. <i>Goe</i>, as has been seen
above, is the name of the month, but the Göje new moon has
been shewn to be the second after Epiphany, and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
the moon following the <i>disting</i>-moon, which is identical with
the <i>Tor</i> new moon. Herein lies an unexplained difficulty. It
is to be presumed, however, that the arrangement of the
heathen lunar months must have been different from that of
the Christian Easter moons, and that this must have been the
cause of the difference in the position of the moons. The heathen
<i>disting</i>-moon, called <i>Goe</i>, did not entirely correspond either
to the Christian <i>þorre</i> or to <i>Goe</i>: Snorre has made <i>Goe</i> equivalent
to it, otherwise it has been made equivalent to <i>þorre</i>.
The necessity of computing the Christian Easter has very often
caused the new moons to fall after the period (Yule, Tor,
Goe) from which they are named. On the contrary the <i>disting</i>-moon
is the very moon in which the <i>disting</i> is held. This is
certainly a survival of an older pre-Christian computation,
which was later fitted into the Christian computation of the
new moons before Easter, and was re-arranged accordingly.</p>

<p>In the other Scandinavian countries also the enumeration
of the moons between Christmas and Easter was neglected after
the Reformation had made the observation of the fast superfluous,
or rather it was replaced by another: the New Year’s
Day appears as the regulating point instead of Epiphany.</p>

<p>The Swedish almanacs of the 16th and 17th centuries
give the new moons in words, the practice ceasing in the second
half of the 17th century. In accordance with the custom
of the ecclesiastical computation the new moon is (nearly always)
named after the following month, that in which the moon
ceases: <i>Ny Göijemånat</i>, the new moon of Göje, therefore falls
in <i>Torsmånad</i> (January), and so on. Sometimes, doubtless inadvertently,
the new moon is named after the month in which it falls,
i. e. <i>Ny Göijemånat</i> falls in February. Now certain years receive
13 new moons, and therefore one intercalary moon, for which
the computers give rules. But the almanac-makers never follow
these rules. In two or three of the oldest almanacs<a id="FNanchor_1029" href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a> the intercalary
moon is certainly described as such<a id="FNanchor_1030" href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a>, but its position
in the year does not correspond to the rule of the computers:
in 1603 it is simply placed in the Julian month in which two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
new moons fall. Otherwise the difficulty is got over by leaving
uncounted the intercalary moon or some of the new moons.
Another way out is chosen by Herlicius, 1630 and 1641, and Thuronius
of Åbo, 1660: <i>Torsmånadsny</i>, the new moon of January, is
contrary to the rule placed in January; in the further enumeration
the new moons run over into the month preceding
that after which they are named, and the thirteenth and last
new moon is again called <i>Torsmånadsny</i>, i. e. this is doubled
and serves as an intercalary moon. Here, therefore, the insertion
of the intercalary moon depends upon the position of
the new moon in relation to the beginning of the year, i. e.
to the first of January.</p>

<p>This method has become popular, and its popularity has
been assisted by the fact that the people, through the use of
the rune-staves recording the golden numbers, were accustomed
to the calculation of the new moon. Above all the first moon
of the year (<i>nykung</i> = ‘new king’) played a very important
part. The men took off their hats and the women curtseyed
when they saw it; from it were taken oracles for the new
year. The question is whether a popular name was also given
to the new moons. Apart from the almanacs, which use the
names of months introduced into them, I find in Swedish only
one example: <i>Torretungel</i> (<i>tungel</i>, dialect for ‘new moon’)<a id="FNanchor_1031" href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a>.
The Danish chronologist Worm gives both a lunar and a solar
series of names of months<a id="FNanchor_1032" href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a>. The names are for the most
part equivalent or similar to those of the solar series, but in
the first half of the year they occupy an earlier position, which
fact certainly has something to do with the naming of the
new moons according to the usual computation. Worm expressly
states that these lunar months were still in use and began
with the first new moon of the new year.</p>

<p>An account of connected lunar months among the East
Finns has been translated and communicated to me by Professor
Wiklund. The authority makes a man of the people
speak as follows<a id="FNanchor_1033" href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a>:&mdash;“The moon which is born while the
winter day is still in his house (December 18&ndash;22), or after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
that, is the first heart- (middle-)moon. In this way the Christmas
festival sometimes falls in the first heart-moon, and then
we hope for a good harvest. But when the first heart-moon
is born late, e. g. after Twelfth Day, there is no second heart-moon
in this year, but there follow the foam-moon (so called
because the snow looks like foam), the snow-crust moon, the
melting moon, the sprouting moon, etc.... When we reckon
the moons of the year, beginning with the first heart-moon, we
sometimes get thirteen months in the year, although there are
only twelve book-months.” At first sight it is very tempting
to see in this account old Finnish moon-months regulated by
the winter solstice, as e. g. among the Siberian peoples, which
would be quite conceivable so far north. However this is not
so. The heart-moon is in the given instance doubled, i. e. it
is an intercalary moon. Now it is a familiar fact that the
intercalary month, i. e. the first of the two months with the
same name, gets in front of the regulating-point; it is therefore
‘forgotten’, and a second moon with the same name is
inserted after it. We must therefore ask:&mdash;Within what
limits, under the given conditions, will the moon fall which in
ordinary years is the heart-moon, in leap-year the second heart-moon?
The following tables give the answer: the limits begin
at the two extremes of new moon on the first and on the
twenty-ninth of January; we must of course reckon one day
for the solstice, December 21, and not the whole ‘house’.</p>

<p>The regulating-point is therefore New Year’s Day: the heart-moon,
and in leap-year the second heart-moon, begin with the
first new moon after this. This rule however makes it impossible
for the first heart-moon ever to begin before the winter
solstice. It will be found that in regard to the position of the
heart-month, and in leap-years of the first heart-month, this
regulation leads to such a position of these months as is given
in the account. The calendar is therefore not a native lunar
one, but the already mentioned adaptation of the lunar reckoning
in accordance with the new year of the Julian calendar<a id="FNanchor_1034" href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a>.
The Finns, who from the earliest times have owed their culture
to the Scandinavians, have taken this process from them
also, but in Finland it has not been driven out by the influences
of later civilisation, just as in Norway, which long remained
comparatively untouched by these influences, the Catholic
lunar reckoning has been preserved.</p>

<p>The above-quoted source unfortunately does not preserve
all the names of months. A similar but somewhat different
complete list has been drawn up by Lönnrot in Karelia:&mdash;1,
heart-month; 2, heart-month; 3, foam-month; 4, tree-felling
month; 5, melting or sowing month; 6, summer month; 7, hay
month; 8, pus month (cf. the Swedish ‘rotten month’, above,
p. 300); 9, harvest month; 10, autumn month; 11, dung or dirt
month; 12, month of clods; 13, Christmas month<a id="FNanchor_1035" href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a>. Here too
the heart-month appears doubled.</p>

<p>The Lapps also have taken their reckoning from the
Scandinavians: of the reckoning in weeks we have spoken
above. In Old Scandinavian times they borrowed the word <i>mānō</i>,
Lapp <i>manno</i> (moon). The Lapp word means both ‘moon’ and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
‘month’; only among the southern Lapps is there found a native
word <i>aske</i>, ‘moon’, which one dictionary also uses as a
term for ‘month’. Therefore at the time when the Lapps
adopted the word <i>manno</i> for ‘moon’ and ‘month’, the month
of the Scandinavians must have been a lunar month, and so
also among the Lapps. In some authors the form <i>mannod</i>
occurs, i. e. modern Swedish <i>månad</i>, ‘month’. The Lapp names
of months were not collected until last century. They appear
sometimes with, sometimes without, the addition ‘month’. They
are:&mdash;1, new month, new year (month), new day (month),
New Year’s Day month; 2, Göjem. (<i>knowa</i>, a loan-word therefore),
rarely *‘swan month’; 3, *‘swan month’, because the
swan comes in March, rarely <i>marasm.</i> (<i>mars</i>, loan-word), rarely
*‘crow month’; 4, *‘crow month’, on account of the coming of
these birds, rarely *‘snow-crust month’; 5, ‘(hard) *snow-crust
month’, since the surface of the snow, which melts in the day-time
in the bright sunshine, freezes at night into a hard crust,
*‘month of calves’, ‘calf month’, when the reindeer bring forth
their calves; 6, *‘month of calves’, *‘fir month’, since the sap
rises in the firs, ‘flesh month’, ‘(mid)summer month’; 7, rarely
*‘fir month’, *‘month when the reindeer has shed its hair’; 8,
called *the same, also *‘month when the hair has grown thick
again’; 9, has *the same name as 8, or *‘rutting month’ (the
rutting-time covers the end of September and the beginning
of October), or *‘month when the male reindeer are powerless’
(after the rutting); 10, has *the same name as 9, or else
*‘rutting month’, or ‘autumn month’; 11, is also generally called
*‘month when the male reindeer are powerless’, rarely *‘Advent
month’; 12, *‘Advent month (<i>passatis(m.)</i>, <i>p.</i> means the
first Advent Sunday and the first week in Advent), ‘Yule
month’<a id="FNanchor_1036" href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a>. Qvigstad<a id="FNanchor_1037" href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a> calls the twelfth week-month of the Lapps
<i>bâse-tæbme manno</i>, ‘the month without a feast’, the thirteenth
<i>basse m.</i> or <i>juowla m.</i></p>

<p>The Lapps were also acquainted with the ‘rotten month’
(<i>mieska manno</i>, Swedish <i lang="sv" xml:lang="sv">rötmånad</i>)<a id="FNanchor_1038" href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a>. A Lapp woman mentioned
by Wiklund gave this month the position of the ninth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
in the series, and explained it as the month in which the grass
begins to fade and rot. On the strength of this Wiklund assumes
a thirteen-month year, but the statement is inconclusive,
the ‘rotten month’ having certainly been placed erroneously
as a separate month in the series. That this is so is supported
not only by Qvigstad but also by Högström in his description
of Lapland of the year 1746, in which he speaks of thirteen
week-months of the Lapps. According to this authority
the Lapps drew their rune-calendar on seven discs of reindeer-horn,
but only one side of the seventh was written on, so that
there were 13 sides of four weeks each, which they called a
month, and so their reckoning was 13 months, he says. Wiklund
has accepted this four-week month. It is quite possible
that the Lapps called a period of four weeks a month: we
also often do the same when an approximation will serve; but
that the names of months mean periods of four weeks seems
very questionable. It would be a quite isolated case: everywhere
else the months are either the Julian or lunar months,
with which last the Lapps were acquainted, at least in ancient
times. The statement that on the basis of the reckoning by
weeks a four-week month could have arisen is certainly not
absolutely to be denied,&mdash;if this is so, it must be a secondary
and late development&mdash;but the fluctuation of the names
of months is no evidence for this. It is only the fluctuation
found everywhere when names of seasons are transformed
into names of months. Only the names of the first two months
are quite fixed, and these are either essentially or literally
loan-words: the Latin name even appears in one instance
for March. There is consequently borrowing in the case of
the three names which alone, as also among the Scandinavians,
have become really popular. If the Lapps really had thirteen
months, it might then be supposed that these, as in Denmark
and Finland, were lunar months which began at the first new
moon of the new year. But we find no trace of lunar months
in Lapland in historical times. We must therefore content
ourselves with the fact that the Lapp names of months shew
the same fluctuation as is shewn by all names taken from natural
objects or phenomena and applied to the months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span></p>

<p>This brief survey of the popular months of the European
peoples is instructive from the point of view of a comparison
with the names of months among primitive peoples. Although
the Julian months have a fixed position in the solar year, and
do not fluctuate to and fro like the lunar months, yet the
names of the months are unstable and fluctuating. This is due
to the fact that in the desire for concrete observations the
names of the seasons and of their occupations have been kept,
and the seasons have neither fixed position nor duration: these
names of months derived from natural phenomena and occupations
have not therefore in themselves the precision which
the chronological system demands. Such precision will only
be introduced by an external factor, in the one case by the
lunar months, in the other by the Julian months to which the
names of the seasons are transferred.</p>

<span class="fs70">SOLSTICES AND EQUINOXES. AIDS TO THE DETERMINATION OF TIME.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy1">We have seen in the foregoing pages how the phases of
Nature, with their somewhat variable dates, are everywhere
employed in the determination of time; how in the moon
there lies ready to hand a clear, stable (at least within very narrow
limits), and constant unit of time which could be turned to
account in calculating; and how out of the fusion of natural
phases and moons there arose a roughly empirical lunisolar
year. For the more accurate fixing both of the seasons and
of the months the phases of the stars are employed; these,
being dependent on the sun, keep pace with the natural year,
but, unlike the phases of Nature, are not subject to climatic
variations but are astronomically fixed.</p>

<p>It is however possible astronomically to fix the solar year by
a second method, viz. the observation of the annual course of the
sun, especially of the solstices: the observation of the equinoxes
is a much more difficult matter. The observation of the solstices
can be performed in a way similar to that mentioned <a href="#Page_21">above, p.
21</a>, in which noon is determined by the position of the sun,
but is much more difficult to carry out and requires far more
accurate and delicate methods. Two fixed points at least are
necessary&mdash;a standing-ground and in the simplest case a
mark on the horizon; other methods are still more complicated.
An observation of the annual course of the sun, therefore,
unlike that of the stars,&mdash;which everywhere, no matter where,
can be performed immediately&mdash;demands a fixed place and
special aids to determination. It follows that the observation
of the solstices and equinoxes belongs to a much higher stage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
of civilisation than does that of the stars. It can only arise
among a people with a fixed dwelling-place, since a race
which leads a nomadic life and changes dwellings and camps
is without the necessary fixed points of observation. After all
it is only natural&mdash;and this actually is the case&mdash;that the
observation of the course of the sun should be in use only
among certain specially gifted peoples.</p>

<p>It is used by the Eskimos, who have a very highly developed
sense of place, and know how to make good maps.
Moreover where the sun in winter stands very low on the horizon,
and for a time altogether disappears beneath it, the conditions
are very favourable for the observation of its return. Older
authors say that by the rays of the sun on the rocks the
Eskimos can tell with tolerable accuracy when it is the shortest
day<a id="FNanchor_1039" href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a>; more recently we have been told of the Ammasalik
that they can calculate beforehand the time of the shortest day&mdash;and
that accurately to the day&mdash;not only from the solstitial
point, but also from the position of Altair in the morning
twilight<a id="FNanchor_1040" href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a>. They begin their spring when the sun rises
at the same spot as Altair<a id="FNanchor_1041" href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a>. This is a quite isolated, but an
accurate, determination of the course of the sun from the fixed
stars. The Hudson Bay Eskimos of Labrador recognise the arrival
of the solstices by the bearing of the sun with reference to
certain fixed landmarks<a id="FNanchor_1042" href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a>. The Central Eskimos must do the
same, since they are acquainted with the winter solstice and
when this and new moon coincide they omit their intercalary
month<a id="FNanchor_1043" href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a>.</p>

<p>The tribes of Arizona observed the course of the sun,
more particularly to determine the dates of their religious
ceremonies, but also to decide the time of secular occupations.
Among the Zuñi the winter solstice begins when the rising sun
strikes a certain point at the south-west end of ‘Corn Mountain’,
and a great feast is then celebrated. Then the sun
moves to the north, passes the moon at <i>ayonawa yälläne</i>, and
continues round to a point north-west of Zuñi, which is called
‘Great Mountain’, where it sets consecutively for four days at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
the same point. The last day is the summer solstice. On this
occasion also a great festival is celebrated<a id="FNanchor_1044" href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a>. The Hopi determine
the time for their religious ceremonies, for planting, and
for sowing by observing the points on the horizon where the
sun rises or sets. The winter ceremonies are determined by
the position of the sunset, the summer by the position of the
sunrise. The two points of the solstices are called the ‘houses’
of the sun. There are 13 landmarks, by means of which the
seasons are determined from the ecliptic. The number suggests
that there is some connexion with the months. It would in
that case be a quite isolated example of the regulation of the
months by the observation of the sun’s position<a id="FNanchor_1045" href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a>.</p>

<p>The Incas erected artificial marks. There were in Cuzco
sixteen towers, eight to the west and eight to the east, arranged
in groups of four. The two middle ones were smaller
than the others, and the distance between the towers was
eight, ten, or twenty feet. The space between the little towers
through which the sun passed at sunrise and sunset was the
point of the solstices. In order to verify this the Inca chose
a favourable spot from which he observed carefully whether
the sun rose and set between the little towers to east and
west. For the observation of the equinoxes richly ornamented
pillars were set up in the open space before the temple of
the sun. When the time approached, the shadow of the pillars
was carefully observed. The open space was circular and a
line was drawn through its centre from east to west. Long
experience had taught them where to look for the equinoctial
point, and by the distance of the shadow from this point they
judged of the approach of the equinox. When from sunrise to
sunset the shadow was to be seen on both sides of the pillar
and not at all to the south of it, they took that day as the day
of the equinox. This last account is for Quito, which lies just
under the equator. At the spring equinox the maize was
reaped and a feast was celebrated, at the autumn equinox the
people celebrated one of their four principal feasts<a id="FNanchor_1046" href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a>. The
months were calculated from the winter solstice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span></p>

<p>Among the Amazulu, we are told, the path of the sun in
winter is different from its summer path: for it travels northward
till it reaches a certain place,&mdash;a mountain or a forest (where
it rises and sets)&mdash;and it does not pass beyond these two
places; it comes out of its winter house; when it comes out
it goes southward to its summer place. We say that when it
quits its winter place it is fetching the summer, until it
reaches a certain mountain or tree; and then it turns northward
again, fetching the winter, in constant succession. These are
its houses; we say so, for it stays in its winter house a few
days: and when it quits that place we know that it has ended
the winter and is now fetching the summer; and indeed it
travels southward until, when the summer has grown, it enters
the summer house a few days, and then quits it again, in
constant succession<a id="FNanchor_1047" href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a>. The Basuto also call the summer solstice
the house of the sun, and intelligent chiefs adjust the
reckoning of the months by it<a id="FNanchor_1048" href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a>.</p>

<p>For the Bismarck Archipelago the following details are
given. On the island of Vuatam there is celebrated some
time after the solstice and usually at the beginning of January&mdash;the
exact date depends on the weather&mdash;a festival the
object of which is to regulate the course of the sun and to secure
good weather. In the whole of the north-eastern part of the
Gazelle Peninsula the fact of the solstice is known, although
no festival is celebrated. When the sun had its greatest
southern amplitude it rose over Birar on St. George’s Channel.
A native magistrate, To Kakao, explained how the sun would
turn again and would finally attain its greatest northern
amplitude on the horizon when it sank between the volcanic
mountains ‘South Daughter’ and ‘Mother’. In Valaur the view
is completely cut off to the east, and so the sun is observed
at its setting, the turning-point in the south being formed by
two mountain peaks situated close together. Another southern
turning-point is furnished by still another mountain. The spot
denoting the turning-point in the Baining mountain is chosen
rather far off, and the observation is therefore not very accurate.
The solstices are brought into connexion with the variation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
the monsoons. To Kakao said that the north-east trade-wind
blew all the time the sun was in the south (November to
February), but during the time when it was situated in a
northerly direction (May to August) the south-east monsoon
prevailed. In Valaur the south-east monsoon blows as long as
the sun sets WNW (May to August): but from November to
February, when the sun sets WSW, the north-west trade blows<a id="FNanchor_1049" href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a>.
The Moanu of the Admiralty Islands name the divisions of
the year according to the position of the sun. If it stands
north of the equator the division in question is called <i>morai
im paün</i> (‘war sun’), since it is during this time more particularly
that wars are carried on. When the sun stands above
the equator this division is named <i>morai in kauas</i> (‘sun of
friendship’): this is the time of peace and of mutual visits.
When the sun turns southward the colder season, <i>morai unonou</i>,
begins<a id="FNanchor_1050" href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a>.</p>

<p>One would suspect that this Melanesian science, like the
knowledge of the stars, is borrowed from the Polynesians: for the
latter understood the annual course of the sun. In Tahiti the place
of the sunrise was called <i>tataheita</i>, that of the sunset <i>topa-t-era</i>.
The annual movement of the sun from the south towards the
north was recognised, and so was the fact that all these points of
the daily approach to the zenith lay in a line. This meridian
was called <i>t’era-hwattea</i>, the northern point of it <i>tu-errau</i>, and
the opposite point above the horizon, or the south, <i>toa</i><a id="FNanchor_1051" href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a>.
According to other sources the December solstice was called
<i>rua-maoro</i> or <i>rua-roa</i>, the June solstice <i>rua-poto</i>. The Hawaiians
called the northern limit of the sun in the ecliptic
‘the black, shining road of Kane’, and the southern limit ‘the
black, shining road of Kanaloa’. The equator was named ‘the
bright road of the spider’ or ‘the road to the navel of Wakea’,
equivalent to ‘the centre of the world’<a id="FNanchor_1052" href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a>. How the Polynesians
came to recognise the tropics and the equator is unfortunately
unknown, but certainly they did it like other peoples
by observing the solstices and equinoxes at certain landmarks.</p>

<p>That the Greeks also recognised the solstices by means<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
of the observation of certain landmarks may be gathered from
a passage in Homer. In the Odyssey Eumaeus says of his native
land: “A certain island Syrie ... above Ortygia, where the
sun turns”<a id="FNanchor_1053" href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a>. Wherever Syrie lay, even though in the realm of
fable, the idea is that it lies in the direction of the spot at
which the sun at its turning rises or sets. It therefore serves
as a landmark, it is ‘the house of the sun’. Hesiod is so familiar
with the winter and summer solstices that he reckons time
from them in days<a id="FNanchor_1054" href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a>.</p>

<p>A much discussed question is whether the ancient Germans
were acquainted with the solstices and equinoxes, an assumption
which must be adopted by anyone who regards the Yule
festival as a solstitial festival. Their acquaintance with these
points has been denied and with this view I myself have concurred<a id="FNanchor_1055" href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a>.
After my researches in primitive time-reckoning,
however, I can no longer maintain this opinion for the later
heathen times of the north. For it has been shewn that
primitive peoples&mdash;and especially those living far north, e. g.
the Eskimos&mdash;observed the solstices well from certain points on
the horizon. Now it has already been seen that the northern
peoples observed the times of day in the same manner<a id="FNanchor_1056" href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a>, and
this observation was also extended to the annual course of
the sun. It is said, for example, that autumn lasts from the
equinox until the sun sets in <i>eyktarstað</i>, i. e. the position in
which it stands in the <i>eykt</i><a id="FNanchor_1057" href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a>; and that south of Iceland and Greenland
the sun at the time of the shortest days inhabits <i>eyktarstað</i>
and <i>dagmálastað</i> (that is to say at 9 a. m.)<a id="FNanchor_1058" href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a>. The evidence,
it is true, comes down from Christian days: but the method
of determining time is of native origin and certainly goes back
into heathen times. Hence it should not be denied that, although
nothing of the kind has transpired, the solstices and
equinoxes might have been approximately determined in the
same way, and it may be that the regulation of the calendar
profited by this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span></p>

<p>Any other day of the year can be fixed by observation
in the same way, though the observation of the solstices is probably
the oldest. As late as the beginning of the 19th century
this method was adopted in Norway as a check to the prime-staff.
On certain farms there was a definite stone, buried in
the earth, to which the people repaired for these observations.
They noticed when the sun rose and shone out above certain
mountain peaks, or when its last rays touched this or that
summit. They also observed the length of the shadow on the
face of a cliff, or noted when it touched the brow of a mountain
or a certain stone. Thence they were able to give the
important days of the year, e. g. the festival of St. Paul or
Candlemas. Our authority says that the observation was very
inaccurate, so that the Christmas Day of the people might fall
on January 2. But it was not so bad as that, since they still
followed the old style. The sun-mark for the first summer
day (April 14) agreed with the 23rd of April<a id="FNanchor_1059" href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a>.</p>

<p>Agricultural peoples in particular have developed various
methods of this kind. The rice-cultivating peoples of the
East Indies use various methods in order to determine the
important time of sowing. Of the observation of the stars we
have already spoken<a id="FNanchor_1060" href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a>. Among the Kayan of Sarawak an old
priest determines the official time of sowing from the position
of the sun by erecting at the side of the house two oblong
stones, one larger and one smaller, and then observing the
moment when the sun, in the lengthening of the line of connexion
between these two stones, sets behind the opposite hill.
The sowing-day is the only one determined by astronomical
methods. In other respects the time-reckoning is a more or
less arbitrary one and is dependent on the agriculture<a id="FNanchor_1061" href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a>. Of
the hollows in a block of stone at Batu Sala, in the river-bed
of the upper Mahakam, it is said that they originated in the
fact that the priestesses of the neighbouring tribes used formerly
to sit on the stone every year in order to observe when
the sun would set behind a certain peak of the opposite
mountain. This date then decided the time for the beginning
of the sowing<a id="FNanchor_1062" href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span></p>

<p>In the first example we have artificially erected marks
instead of the usual natural landmarks: compare also the towers
at Cuzco. The pillars of Quito were a kind of gnomon, an instrument
of immense importance for the scientific astronomy
and accurate time-determination of antiquity. In this case the
observation was much simplified on account of the situation
just below the equator. The method is used again in Borneo,
where it is very important to determine the right time for
sowing the seed, and the approach of the short dry season
before it in which the timber from the clearings must be dried
and burnt. The Kenyah observe the position of the sun.
Their instrument is a straight cylindrical pole of hardwood,
fixed vertically in the ground and carefully adjusted with the
aid of plumb-lines; the possibility of its sinking deeper into
the earth is prevented. The pole is a little longer than the
outstretched arms of its maker and stands on a cleared space
by the house, surrounded by a strong fence. The observer has
further a flat stick on which lengths measured from his body
are marked off by notches. The other side has a larger number
of notches, of which one marks the greatest length of the
midday shadow, the next one its length three days after it has
begun to shorten, and so on. The shadow is measured every
midday. As it grows shorter after reaching its maximal length
the man observes it with special care, and announces to the
village that the time for preparing the land is near at hand<a id="FNanchor_1063" href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a>.
In Bali and Java the seasons are determined by the aid of a
gnomon of rude construction, having a dial divided into twelve
parts<a id="FNanchor_1064" href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a>.</p>

<p>The Kayan use a somewhat different method. The weather-prophet
lets in a beam of light through a hole in the roof of
his chamber in the long-house, and measures the distance of
the patch of light from the point vertically below the hole.
Thus they obtain a measurement similar to that given by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
shadow on a sun-dial<a id="FNanchor_1065" href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a>. Still more elaborate is the method
used by some of the Klementan by which time is determined
from the position of a star. A tall bamboo vessel is filled
with water and then inclined until it points directly towards
a certain star. It is set upright again, and the level of the
water left in the vessel is measured. In order to determine
the seed-time the vessel is provided with an empirically given
mark at a certain height, and when the level of the water
coincides with the mark after the inclining of the vessel towards
the star, it is the time for sowing<a id="FNanchor_1066" href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a>. The writers omit to say that
the observation must take place at a certain time of day, e. g.
morning or evening twilight. Then it becomes possible to
determine the season by the height of the star above the
horizon.</p>

<p>All this is neither primitive nor native. In Bali and Java
the Brahmin and Islamite priests observed the sun-dial, and
from there the practice came to Borneo. Where the idea of using
a vessel of water for measurement originated I am unable to
determine, but it is much too refined to be a primitive invention.
The only genuinely primitive method is the observation
of the annual course of the sun and the solstices by the
aid of certain landmarks on the horizon. This method is found
in all parts of the world, but only among certain peoples. It
has never attained real importance for the regulation of the
calendar: the development of the calendar to greater accuracy
proceeds by the indirect way of the lunisolar time-reckoning.</p>

<p>By way of appendix a few notices of the aids used in
calculating may be collected. They are almost always quite
simple&mdash;knots in a string, the tally, or the joints of the body.</p>

<p>The use of the tally in counting the years has already been
dealt with above<a id="FNanchor_1067" href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a>; this use is certainly later, each stick attaining
so to speak an individual life. It is otherwise with the
counting of the days, where the question usually is to determine
the number of days which will elapse before an assembly
or some other undertaking previously agreed upon, so that all
may arrive together. The same reckoning may also occasionally
serve a second purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span></p>

<p>The Peruvian <i>quipos</i> mark the culminating-point of the
method of counting by knots in a cord. Something similar
existed among the Nahyssan of Carolina. Time was measured
and a rude chronology was arranged by means of knots of
various colours. This system proved so convenient in dealing
with the Indians that it was adopted for that purpose by a governor
of South Carolina<a id="FNanchor_1068" href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a>. When a chief of the Miwok of California
decides to hold a dance in his village, he dispatches
messengers to the neighbouring rancherias, each bearing a
string wherein is tied a number of knots. Every morning
thereafter the invited chief unties one of the knots, and when
the last one is reached, they joyfully set forth for the dance&mdash;men,
women, and children<a id="FNanchor_1069" href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a>. Sticks serve the same purpose.
Once when the Natchez and the Chocktaw wished to attack
the French in Louisiana, each tribe received a bundle of sticks,
one of which was to be withdrawn and destroyed each day,
so that they might strike their blows at the same time<a id="FNanchor_1070" href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a>. The
Pawnee used the tally for counting nights, months, and years,
but had advanced so far as to employ picture-writing in doing
so. * means day or sun, × star or night, ☾ moon, month<a id="FNanchor_1071" href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a>. This
is the forerunner of the Indian picture-calendar already mentioned<a id="FNanchor_1072" href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a>.</p>

<p>According to Barrow the Caffres assist their memories
by means of a tally, although this authority did not himself find
this custom among them; but the Hottentot servants of the
colonists, among whom were several Caffres, used this method
in counting the number of the cattle earned<a id="FNanchor_1073" href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a>. Among the
Wagogo if it was desired to count the days, e. g. in connexion
with the sitting of a court of justice, as many knots
were tied in a string as there were nights to elapse before
this date. In Nigeria palm-nuts are used in counting<a id="FNanchor_1074" href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a>, just as
in southern Brazil the years are counted by means of acajou
nuts<a id="FNanchor_1075" href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a>, and as the tribes of Bolivia count with grains of maize<a id="FNanchor_1076" href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a>.
The Baganda, in order to keep in mind the days of the month,
tie knots in a piece of plant-fibre and afterwards count the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
knots<a id="FNanchor_1077" href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a>. In New Guinea the months were counted by means
of notches cut in trees: the New Zealanders are said to have
added every month a little piece of wood or a small stone to
a heap<a id="FNanchor_1078" href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a>.</p>

<p>In the Nicobars notched sticks in the form of a scimitar-blade
are in use. They have notches on the edge and on the
flat, the former denote months, the latter the days of the
waning and waxing moon. They are used e. g. in finding out
when a child of the owner learned to walk. The Shompen
take a piece of bamboo and make as many bends in it as
they mean to reckon days<a id="FNanchor_1079" href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a>. The Negritos of Zambales in
order to count the days make knots in a cord of <i>bejuco</i> and
cut off one of these knots every day<a id="FNanchor_1080" href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a>. On the Solomon Islands
also knotted cords are used for the same purpose<a id="FNanchor_1081" href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a>. The
counting is particularly necessary for the celebrating of the
great feast of the dead at the proper time. The eating the
death, <i>gana matea</i>, begins with the burial; they eat first, as
they say, ‘his graves’, after that they eat ‘his days’&mdash;the
5th, 10th, and after that every ten up to the hundredth, and
it may be, in the case of a father, wife, or mother, even so
far as the thousandth. For counting the days, so that the
guests from distant villages may arrive on the proper days,
they use cycas fronds, one in the hands of each party, on
which the appointed days are marked by the pinching off or
turning down of a leaflet as each day passes<a id="FNanchor_1082" href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a>. According to
another authority the moons are counted. At the coming of
the young moon after the death of a man either a knot is
made in a thread or a notch is cut in a piece of wood. Up
to thirty moons are then counted. The object is to calculate
the time up to the great funeral wake of dead chiefs. For
young people it takes place from 20 to 30 months afterwards,
for old people after 10 months, for an unimportant person as
soon as 3 or 4 months afterwards<a id="FNanchor_1083" href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a>. In Nauru, west of the
Gilbert Islands, knots were tied in a string when days were
to be counted, e. g. the 15 days of the confinement of a
woman<a id="FNanchor_1084" href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span></p>

<p>Only seldom is it mentioned that the months are counted
on the fingers, although obviously this must often happen; the
Klamath and the Modok used to do so formerly<a id="FNanchor_1085" href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a>. Certain
very primitive peoples use not only fingers and toes but
also other parts of the body in counting. The day of an
assembly is determined in this fashion by an Australian tribe
which in words can seldom count more than four. The people
touch various parts of each other’s bodies&mdash;the wrist, the
arm, the head&mdash;each of which stands for a special day, until
the intended day is reached. Thus two or more groups can
accurately determine the lapse of time and can meet on the
day agreed upon<a id="FNanchor_1086" href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a>. The curious names of months of the
Tunguses of the Sea of Okhotsk<a id="FNanchor_1087" href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a> are similarly to be explained,
as is shewn by the method of counting the year used by the
Yukaghir. They call the year <i>n-e’ -malgil</i>, which means ‘all
the joints’. The reckoning of the months by the joints is done
in the following manner. They bend the third row of phalanges
of the fingers on both hands, and put them together. The
line of the joining they call July. Then the knuckles of the
second row of phalanges on the right hand will be August.
The joints between the phalanges and metacarpals represent
September; the wrist-joint is October; the elbow-joint is November;
the shoulder-joint, December; between the head and
the backbone will be January; the shoulder-joint on the left
arm will be February; the elbow-joint, March; the wrist-joint,
April; the joint between the fingers and the palm, May; and
the knuckles of the second row of phalanges on the left hand,
June<a id="FNanchor_1088" href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a>.</p>

<p>These examples may suffice. The subject is monotonous
and is of little importance for the calendar, since the days
are counted independently of the latter, beginning at an arbitrary
starting-point. The counting that is important for the calendar
is that according to the days of the lunar month, but in this
the primitive peoples hold to the concrete phenomenon of the
moon. The habit of reckoning in this fashion may however
be partly responsible for the fact that among certain peoples<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
every day of the month has not been given a name, but the
days are counted from certain points of departure, such as
new moon, full moon, etc. Very rarely do we meet with a
genuinely calendrical use of the tally. The Wa-Sania of East
Africa, who as subjects of the Galla and later since the invasion
of the Somali have been exposed to all kinds of civilising
influences, make a notch for each day, and at the end
of the month the stick is laid aside and a new one comes into
use<a id="FNanchor_1089" href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a>. Similarly at the southern end of Lake Nyassa pieces
of wood strung on a cord are used in counting the days of
the month that have passed<a id="FNanchor_1090" href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a>.</p>

<p>The Kiwai Papuans count the months by means of little
sticks, which are tied into two bundles corresponding to the
two seasons of the year. One end is pointed, the other oblique,
and when a month has passed, the stick corresponding
to it is turned round. The stick belonging to the month <i>keke</i>
is provided with a top-knot and feather, that of <i>karongo</i>
has a mark cut in it and a top-knot like that of <i>keke</i>, but no
feather<a id="FNanchor_1091" href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a>.</p>

<span class="fs70">ARTIFICIAL PERIODS OF TIME. FEASTS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy1">In the more fully developed calendar there are not seldom
found periods of time which are reckoned without reference
to any of the factors given by Nature. Such are, for
example, our months, which, though historically arising from
the lunar month, are now only periods of time with a definite
number of days, independent of the moon. Such also is our
shifting seven-day week, which, chiefly through the agency
of Mohammedanism, has also been widely extended among
peoples of a lower stage of development. These artificial periods,
arising often from a natural period which for purposes
of the calendar has been detached from its natural basis,
belong to a highly developed stage of time-reckoning. Only
among certain comparatively far-advanced, semi-primitive
peoples does an artificial period of the simplest kind first
appear, and then only one, the market-week, the origin of
which it is very easy to understand.</p>

<p>The market-week appears in two widely separated districts&mdash;in
West Central Africa, and in certain of the East
Indian islands. Among the Bakongo the markets are four,
viz. <i>konzo</i>, <i>nkenge</i>, <i>nsona</i>, and <i>nkandu</i>. These have given
their names to the four days that comprise the Congo week.
All the markets held on a certain day all over the Lower
Congo are called <i>konzo</i>, all on the next day <i>nkenge</i>, etc.
These markets are held at different places, e. g. all the <i>konzo</i>
markets are held on different sites from all the markets held
on the three successive days, and are so arranged that one
in four will be within two or three miles of a town, the next
day’s market may be ten miles away from the first town, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
near some other town or towns, the next from 15 to 20 miles,
the next perhaps 25 miles away from the first town. Thus
every village has at least one market during the week within
a reasonable distance of its doors. In order to describe the
markets the place-names are sometimes added, e. g. <i>nsona
Ngungu</i>. Each market has its special wares<a id="FNanchor_1092" href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a>. The Babwende
have the same names<a id="FNanchor_1093" href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a>. Three Bantu tribes of the Congo
State have the four-day week, but in certain cases with different
names; one of the days is market-day<a id="FNanchor_1094" href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a>. This is a very
practical arrangement, which must gradually have regulated
itself. There are also greater markets which are held every
eight days<a id="FNanchor_1095" href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a>&mdash;a doubling of the period, therefore. The same
is the case among the Edo-speaking peoples, among whom the
week is everywhere a recognised period of time, and is, properly
speaking, 4 days long, this being the interval between
the two markets at any given spot. Occasionally, as in the
Ida district, eight-day markets are found, but the names applied
to the intervening days clearly shew that a four-day week was
the primary one. One of the four days is commonly known
as the rest-day, and on this day men frequently stop at home,
though farm-work is not absolutely forbidden. Women, on the
other hand, go to market as usual<a id="FNanchor_1096" href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a>. Among the Ibo-speaking
peoples the names of the four days are <i>eke</i>, <i>oye</i>, <i>afo</i>, and
<i>nkwo</i>. These are the same names as those of the Bini, but
<i>afo</i> and <i>oye</i> are in the inverted order; it is idle to speculate
on the origin of the names<a id="FNanchor_1097" href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a>. In Loango the four days are
variously named, but principally they are called <i>nssona</i>, <i>nduka</i>,
<i>ntono</i>, <i>nsilu</i>, which names are also often applied to the open
spaces where markets are held on the days in question; <i>nssona</i>
corresponds to our Sunday<a id="FNanchor_1098" href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a>, i. e. it is a day of rest.</p>

<p>The Yoruba have, besides the market-week, a longer one
of 16 (or 17) days. Of these two periods Ellis says:&mdash;The
Yoruba week consists of five days, and six of them are supposed
to make a lunar month, which however always begins with the
new moon. (This is therefore the familiar round number.) The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
days are:&mdash;1, <i>ako-ojo</i>, the first day, day of general rest,
considered unlucky; the temples are swept and water is brought
in procession for the use of the gods. No business of importance
is ever undertaken on this day. 2, <i>ojo-awo</i>, ‘day of
the secret’, sacred to Ifa. 3, <i>ojo-Ogun</i>, 4, <i>ojo-Shango</i>, 5,
<i>ojo-Obatula</i>, i. e. the name of a god, added to the word ‘day’.
Each of these four days is a day of rest for the followers of
the god to which it is dedicated, and for them only, but <i>ako-ojo</i>
is a day of rest for all. Markets are held every fifth day
in different townships, but never on the <i>ako-ojo</i>. From this
custom has arisen another mode of computing time, namely
by periods of 17 days, called <i>eta-di-ogun</i> (‘three less than
twenty’). This is the outcome of the Esu societies, the members
of which meet every fifth market-day. The first and fifth
market-days are counted in, and thus the number 17 is obtained.
For instance, supposing the second day of a month to be a
market-day, the second market would fall on the 6th, the third
on the 10th, the fourth on the 14th, and the fifth on the 18th.
The fifth market-day, on which the members meet, is counted
again as the first of the next series. These clubs are so
common that the 17-day period has become a kind of auxiliary
measure of time<a id="FNanchor_1099" href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a>. The account contains an inward contradiction.
Ellis enumerates five days and says that the market
is held every fifth day, but when he reckons the days again
below, the periods are four-day periods. We must probably
assume that the word <i>ako-ojo</i> is applied to one of the four
days, denoting it to be a day of rest, and that Ellis, when he
says that the market is held every fifth day, is counting inclusively
according to the linguistic usage of the natives, as
the Greeks also did. This is the opinion of another authority,
who writes as follows:&mdash;Some say the Yoruba week is
composed of four days, and some of five. This same mystification
recurs in the number of days said to complete one
of their months. Some say there are sixteen and others seventeen
days in a month. The natives rest on the fifth day,
that is to say, having counted four days, they really rest on
the first day of the next week, counting that day as one. So<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
in their next great division of time they say that they rest on
the seventeenth day, which is a great market-day, and this is,
of course, the first day of what is their second so-called month.
Fourteen of these months complete the ancient Yoruba so-called
year of 224 days<a id="FNanchor_1100" href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a>.</p>

<p>But there are also periods of time of other durations.
The Adeli of the hinterland of Togo divide the lunar month
into five weeks of six days<a id="FNanchor_1101" href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a>; unfortunately the brief account
tells us nothing of the nature of this six-day week. The Tshi-speaking
peoples usually reckon time in periods of 40 or 42
days, every fortieth or forty-second day being a festival termed
the great <i>adae</i>, 18 or 20 days after which is the little <i>adae</i>. The
great <i>adae</i> is always celebrated on a Sunday, and the little
<i>adae</i> on a Wednesday<a id="FNanchor_1102" href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a>. Once again the statements are not
clear. If the last condition must be absolutely fulfilled, the
period of the great <i>adae</i> must always embrace 42 days and
the little <i>adae</i> must fall 18 days after it. The natives consider
the number 40 particularly lucky and always endeavour to
connect it with some important event<a id="FNanchor_1103" href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a>. The probable explanation
is that 40 is used as a round number instead of 42.
But among the Edo-speaking peoples also, at one point in
Northern Nigeria, a twenty-day month seems to be used<a id="FNanchor_1104" href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a>. The
former mode of reckoning is connected with the seven-day
week adopted by the Tshi-speaking peoples, though this, in
order that it may cover the lunar month, is reckoned in a
curious fashion so that each week consists of 7 days 9 hours;
each so-called day is therefore somewhat longer than the natural
day and consequently also begins at a different hour of
the natural day. Hence the two <i>adae</i> also begin at different
hours of the day. The same curious reckoning is found among
the Gã-tribes. This mode of computation is a far from primitive
refinement, the real object of which is the fitting of the
seven-day week into the lunar month, the natural day however
being abandoned. There is connected with it a strong day-superstition.
The first day of the ‘week’ is rest-day, and that
on which the new moon falls is an absolute rest-day, the following<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
being days of rest only for certain trades, e. g. the
second for the fishermen, the third for the agriculturalists<a id="FNanchor_1105" href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a>.
It is clear that the only period which can pass as native is
the four-day market-week, with its development the 16-day
period, and perhaps also the too little known 6-day week.</p>

<p>In Java, Bali, and Sumatra there is a five-day market-week
called <i>pasar</i>, in Bali also a four-day <i>tjaturwara</i><a id="FNanchor_1106" href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a>; alongside
of these the seven-day week is in use. But wherever
among heathen tribes a ‘week’ is spoken of, this is always the
market-week<a id="FNanchor_1107" href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a>. In Java and Bali the <i>pasar</i>-week is combined
with the 7-day week in divisions of 35 days. Six of these
periods form a <i>wuku</i>, a kind of year of 210 days. Besides
these there are still other divisions, which are of importance
for the sooth-sayers. The non-Islamite Lampong of Sumatra
combine the <i>pasar</i>-week with the lunar month, which is counted
as 30 days<a id="FNanchor_1108" href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a>. We have here nothing to do with the
highly developed time-reckoning of those peoples that drew
up their systems under Indian and Islamite influence. This
five-day week has a very extensive use in Further India: we
meet it in Tonkin, in the Lao states of northern Siam, in Upper
Burma among the Shan; further in Celebes and in certain
parts of New Guinea. In the Malay Peninsula there is a five-day
period for the determination of lucky and unlucky days.
In other parts of New Guinea and in the Gazelle Peninsula of
New Pommern the market takes place every third day. Of
market-days in Polynesia there are unfortunately only uncertain
accounts<a id="FNanchor_1109" href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a>.</p>

<p>In ancient Mexico a market was held every fifth day at
every important place, just as in Africa on different days in
neighbouring districts; the day was a rest-day, and with the
market games and amusements were associated. This five-day
market-week appears also in other parts of Central America.
The Muysca of Bogota in Columbia, on the other hand, held
markets every third, and the Inca peoples every tenth, day,
when the country-folk ceased from labour, assembled in the towns,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
and engaged in traffic and games<a id="FNanchor_1110" href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a>. These three- and ten-day
periods are said to be brought into connexion with the month; if
this statement be correct, they are not continuous periods, and the
market-day must sometimes have been pushed out of place in
order to secure the agreement with the moon; but the certainty
cannot be ascertained.</p>

<p>The market-week exists therefore, as we should expect, only
among peoples with a more fully developed commerce and trade.
The rule attains greater importance for the time-reckoning
only when, as in the East Indies, it is introduced into an already
existing calendarial system. In Africa larger divisions of time
have arisen on the basis of it, and in one case, that of the Yoruba,
the agricultural year has been thus divided. The market-weeks,
however, may also occur independently, alongside of
the calendar, like the Roman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nundinae</i>, which were held every
eighth day and took their name (from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">novem</i>) from the inclusive
reckoning.</p>

<p>The question of the Israelitish sabbath is complicated
and has been much discussed as a point of connexion with
the Babylonian civilisation. In Babylonia one day in the month
was called <i>shabattu</i>, and the seventh day was specially distinguished.
The statement that there the seven-day week existed,
but as a fixed subdivision of the month, is often heard, but is
an invention. I borrow the material from Landsberger’s section
on the month in religious worship. A cylinder of Gudea already
mentions a festival of the opening of the month in Lagash,
festivals in honour of the goddesses Bau and Nina are celebrated
in special new-moon houses. At all times, and later
too, the day of the new moon is a great festival-day. At the
time of the dynasty of Ur, under the empire of Khammurabi,
and later, sacrifices were offered on the fifteenth day, the day
of full moon. This is called <i>shabattu</i>, which word in the time
of Assurbani-pal also denotes the full-moon day without any
religious implication. We also find at the time of the
dynasty of Ur occasional sacrifices on the day of the ‘going
to sleep’, i. e. of the disappearance of the moon. These are
the three days marked out by the great phases of the moon.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
According to them the month is divided into two halves. A
Babylonian peculiarity is that the seventh day of the month,
as at the time of the dynasty of Ur and under the empire of
Khammurabi, becomes a day of special sacrifices. It is called
<i>sibutu</i>, ‘the seventh’, cp. Assyrian <i>sibittu</i>, ‘seven’ (fem.). The
1st, the 7th, and the 28th are therefore of religious importance;
for a similar emphasising of the 21st testimony is as yet lacking;
instead of the 14th we have the 15th. Later, after ancient
Babylonian times, the 7th becomes a day of taboo, the number
7 is made an unlucky number, and the schematic series 1, 7,
14, 21, 28, and 19 of the following month is formed (30 + 19
= 49 = 7 × 7). Hence the 14th is also sometimes designated
as the day of full moon. Thus, for example, in the Creation
epic, tablet 5, vv. 12 ff.:&mdash;“At the beginning of the month
shine in the land. Beam with thy horns, to make known
six days. On the seventh day halve thy disc. On the fourteenth
day thou shalt reach the half of the monthly (growth);”
in what follows the indications of the days are unfortunately
missing. It is clear that the septenary division has not arisen
from the phases of the moon, but on the contrary the phases
of the moon have been arranged in accordance with the
septenary scheme. They might also be arranged according to
a quintuple scheme. Thus the tablet III R 55, no. 3<a id="FNanchor_1111" href="#Footnote_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a>:&mdash;“Sin
at his appearance from the first to the fifth day, five days, is
crescent,&mdash;Anu; from the sixth to the tenth day, five days, he
is kidney,&mdash;Ea; from the eleventh to the fifteenth, five days,
he covers himself with the shining royal cap.” It is significant
of the phases of the moon that have arisen on genuinely primitive
grounds that, since they are originally concrete, they do
not divide themselves into symmetrical groups of days. Here
the numerical scheme has been at work, and this cannot
be referred to the phases, since these give no other naturally
grounded divisions than the halves of the month.</p>

<p>The derivation of the Israelitish sabbath from Babylonia
therefore offers two difficulties:&mdash;1, in regard to the word,
Babylonian <i>shabattu</i> means the day of full moon, in fact the
fifteenth day of the lunar month, and Hebrew <i>shabbat</i>, so far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
as we know, the seventh day of a period that is shifting in relation
to the lunar month; 2, in regard to the period of time, in
Babylonia the septenary scheme is a fixed division of the lunar
month; among the Israelites it is, so far as we know, shifting,
continuous, and independent of the lunar month.</p>

<p>I have emphasised the phrase ‘so far as we know’ since
in reality our sole knowledge in this direction of the Israelitish
times before the Exile is that a festival and rest-day called
the sabbath existed: of its nature we know nothing. The
earliest evidence we have of it is the story of one of the
miracles of Elisha<a id="FNanchor_1112" href="#Footnote_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a>, from which it appears that the adherents
of the prophet were accustomed to gather round him on this
day and at new moon, doubtless since both were rest-days.
In the same way sabbath and new moon are mentioned
together as festival days in Amos VIII, 5, Hosea II, 11, Isaiah
I, 13. The writers during and after the Exile are the first to
mention the sabbath as the seventh day of a continuous seven-day
week. It has at that time the character of an ascetic rest-day,
where the rest is not a joy but a duty.</p>

<p>Any further advance can only be made by way of hypothesis.
Thus the sabbath of the times before the Exile was either,
as later, the last day of a seven-day period that was shifting
in relation to the lunar month, or else it was something different.
Both statements are hypotheses. And if it was something
different we are driven to a still further hypothesis in order
to decide what it was. The suggestion most in favour is that
it was the day of full moon. The sabbath is said to be the
second principal day of the course of the moon simply because
sabbath and new moon are always mentioned together in the
days before the Exile. But this obviously proves nothing. It
has further been stated that the sabbath must be a fixed day
of the lunar month, since otherwise it would sometimes
coincide with the day of new moon; but evidently the expression
‘new moon and sabbath’, however formally interpreted,
does not in itself exclude such a coincidence. Further
sabbath and <i>shabattu</i> are the same word, and consequently a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
second hypothesis is that ‘sabbath’ as well as <i>shabattu</i> means
the day of full moon. The proof is only binding if the word
in itself must mean ‘full moon’; the etymology however is
disputed, so that it gives no help. It is not difficult to establish
a general fundamental sense which will fit in both with the
festival-day of full moon and of the seven-day period.</p>

<p>On the ground of the researches here carried out, however,
we may put a question a satisfactory answer to which is demanded
by the hypothesis just mentioned:&mdash;How is it possible
for a period which forms a fixed subdivision of the lunar month
to become detached from the moon and be made into an independent
period shifting in relation to the lunar month? And
there will still be a preliminary question to get rid of, viz.
how has the septenary period arisen from the day of full moon,
the 15th day of the month? The answer will be, I suppose,
that the 14th, not the 15th, was taken as the day of full moon
and that Babylonian influence introduced the septenary division,
so that the name of one of the septenary days, the 14th, has
been carried over to the rest. But since in the legislation of
the Exile the great festivals were appointed for the 15th, it
is clear that this day, and not the 14th, was at that time taken
as the day of full moon. The question whether any late
Babylonian speculation in numbers may have exercised a determinative
influence upon the Jewish legislation must be decided
by experts. From the unsatisfactory answer to the preliminary
question I return to the main question. A shifting reckoning
of this kind can only be understood chronologically as a
breaking away from the concrete phenomena of Nature,
an incomplete calculation being established instead of the
empirical observation, as was the case, for instance, with
the Egyptian shifting year, put in place of the solar year, and
bringing with it months of thirty days in the place of lunar
months. Now the Israelites have always had the lunar month.
That a day determined by the moon should be detached from
the living lunar month and made into a shifting seven-day
week is quite incomprehensible and entirely without analogy. The
Babylonian septenary days do not help us here, since they always
remained days of the lunar month. In the light of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
foregoing investigations into primitive chronology such a process
would be a sheer miracle.</p>

<p>It remains therefore to regard the creation of the seven-day
week as an act of pure volition on the part of the makers
of the refined exilian legislation, who took the name of the
ancient sabbath, a festival-day of uncertain position, and applied
it to the seventh day of a shifting period. And this is
equally difficult either to prove or disprove. It is seldom
found that a new creation proceeds entirely from nothing, and
no analogy to the shifting seven-day period is anywhere to be
met with&mdash;except in one case to be mentioned presently,
the market-week. Especially in matters chronological would
it appear that the Jewish legislation did not radically break
with antiquity, but systematised and cultivated already existing
tendencies, if we may judge by the few points of departure
handed down from the earlier period; hence the numbered
months, hence the fixing of the great festivals on the day of
full moon. We are speaking here not of the changed religious
character of the sabbath, but of the chronological question.
If therefore fundamental grounds are lacking for the creation
of a shifting seven-day period by the legislation of the Exile,
we must cling to the other hypothesis, viz. that in pre-exilian
times also the sabbath was the seventh day of a shifting period,
which the legislation has transformed in its own fashion.</p>

<p>But if the shifting sabbath is old, the question arises
whether analogous periods exist in primitive time-reckoning.
Certainly they do, and they are periods of a quite definite nature,&mdash;the
market-weeks. There are market-weeks of three, four,
five, six, eight, and ten days: that seven does not appear in any
example must therefore be an accident. The market-week is
spread over the whole earth at a more advanced stage of
civilisation. The market-day is a rest-day, since the people go
to the market: since they rest and gather together it is therefore
a festival day. So also with the Roman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nundinae</i>, on
which no public meetings were held and the schools were
closed. The dispute of Roman scholars as to whether the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nundinae</i> were religious festival-days or business-days is significant<a id="FNanchor_1113" href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
Since the market-day is a day of rest, however, it is
also, as in West Africa, made a taboo day on which work is
forbidden. The connexion between the market and religion is
universal and appears particularly clearly in heathen Arabia<a id="FNanchor_1114" href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a>.
It is true that no market-day is attested for ancient Canaan,
but even in pre-Israelitish times the land was already covered
with towns, so that the conditions for regular markets were
the same as in ancient Greece and Rome. From post-Biblical
times at least three great annual markets are known; one was
held at the terebinth of Hebron, which was at the same time
the object of a cult. In Midrash it is allowed to visit a heathen
yearly market at the half-holidays of the Passover and
of the feast of Tabernacles<a id="FNanchor_1115" href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a>. Since the day was a rest-day,
the command for rest might gradually, through a new interpretation,
be applied to the original purpose of the market, viz.
trade. In Amos VIII, 5 the traders complain:&mdash;“When
will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? And the
sabbath, that we may set forth wheat? making the ephah
small,” etc., but the command for the absolute sabbath’s rest
was certainly not carried out at that time, nor yet in the time
of Jeremiah<a id="FNanchor_1116" href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a>; after the overthrow of the Jewish monarchy the
trade of the markets on the sabbath revived, if indeed it had
ever perished. Nehemiah, three centuries after Amos, has to
give the injunction:&mdash;“ ... and if the peoples of the land bring
ware or any victuals on the sabbath day to sell, that we
would not buy of them on the sabbath, or on a holy day<a id="FNanchor_1117" href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a>,”
and the breach of this law is sternly reprimanded:&mdash;“In
those days saw I in Judah some treading wine-presses on the
sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses therewith;
as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens,
which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day.... There
dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought in fish, and
all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children
of Judah, and in Jerusalem.” Nehemiah reproves the nobles:&mdash;“Did
not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
this evil upon us, and upon this city?”, and he has the gates
shut and guarded when it grows dark before the sabbath.
When, notwithstanding this, the merchants once or twice encamped
outside the walls on the sabbath, he drove them away
with threats<a id="FNanchor_1118" href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a>. At this time work was performed and trade
carried on on the sabbath, though certainly it does not follow
that the sabbath was the principal market-day of the week:
we are speaking of a large town, where no doubt there
was a market every day. But it would be quite in keeping
if in smaller matters the sabbath had once been the proper
market-day.</p>

<p>The work of Webster culminates in an attempt to explain
the sabbath. The author brings together abundant material for
the practice of assigning certain taboos to certain days, partly
notable days in the experience of human life, such as birth,
death, etc., and partly those regularly recurring days which are
dependent on superstitious and religious ideas. Among these
days are found both the market-day and the days of the principal
phases of the moon,&mdash;the day of new moon, in a lesser
degree the day of full moon, and further also the days of the
darkness, of the moon’s invisibility. He rightly distinguishes
the continuous Israelitish week from the ‘unlucky days’ of the
Babylonians, but is nevertheless of the opinion that the sabbath
is really the day of full moon, which in this character was
overlaid with certain taboos and has become independent of
the moon. How this separation was effected, Webster does
not explain: he merely makes the statement. He has not felt
the decisive difficulty, which lies just in this point, because he
has not attacked the problem from its chronological side.
There is no reason to suppose that the day of full moon could
become detached from the genuine lunar month, and such
a process would seem still more strange since the day of
new moon remained a genuine new-moon day. On the other
hand the development of market and rest-day into a day of
taboo is everywhere natural, and is attested in the above
examples from Africa; this taboo character was emphasised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
and inculcated by the late Jewish and exilian legislation in
opposition to the old festive merry-making. The new-moon
day, which had fallen out of the scheme, was at the same
time rejected and proscribed. The suggestion that the sabbath
arose from the market-day is certainly only a hypothesis, since
a definite market-day is not demonstrated for Canaan; but it
has the advantage of remaining within the limits of primitive
time-reckoning, which knows no other continuous periods than
the market-weeks.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Festivals and time-reckoning are from the beginning
inseparably bound together. Some of the former have already
been dealt with, e. g. the festivals of the new moon, the full
moon, and the beginning and end of the year. It remains
briefly to sketch the development of this connexion and to
illustrate it with a few examples. A detailed discussion would
lead us too far away from the main theme into the domain of
the history of religion. How many pages have been written
about the New Year festival alone!</p>

<p>The connexion between festivals and time-reckoning is
grounded in the fact that both are originally dependent on the
phases of Nature. Festivals are already held at definite times
of the year by peoples who know nothing of a proper time-reckoning,
e. g. the much-discussed Intichiuma ceremonies of
the aborigines of Australia. They are closely associated with
the breeding of the animals and the flowering of the plants with
which each totem is respectively identified, and as the object
of the ceremony is to increase the number of the totemic
animal or plant, it is most naturally held at a certain season.
In Central Australia the seasons are limited, so far as the
breeding of animals and the flowering of plants is concerned,
to two&mdash;a dry one of uncertain and often great length, and
a rainy one of short duration and often irregular occurrence.
The latter is followed by an increase in animal life and exuberance
of plant growth. In the case of many of the totems
it is just when there is promise of approach of the good season
that it is customary to hold the ceremony. The exact time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
is fixed by the <i>alatunja</i> (the chief of the local group)<a id="FNanchor_1119" href="#Footnote_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a>. The
ripening of a plant which is an important article of food is
often accompanied by certain ceremonies by which the eating
of the fruit is first made lawful. These so-called sacrifices of
the first-fruits, which have been touched upon above<a id="FNanchor_1120" href="#Footnote_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a>, are therefore
dependent upon a definite natural phase, and there may
be several of them in the course of the year.</p>

<p>At seed-time a festival is celebrated in order to secure
the good growth of the seed. The Bahau of Borneo, who
have the agricultural year<a id="FNanchor_1121" href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a>, celebrate two great festivals, one
at the sowing (<i>tugal</i>, from <i>nugal</i>, ‘to sow’), and one after harvest,
the festival of the new rice-year, <i>dangei</i>, which however
is not held if the harvest has failed; it is the climax of the
year. At both festivals the people gorge themselves to the
full, rice being given even to the animals. But during the
period of growth also the plants need protection and blessing,
various plants require and obtain different festivals, so that a
cycle of agricultural festivals arises<a id="FNanchor_1122" href="#Footnote_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a>. The southern tribes of
the Malay Peninsula celebrate three great agricultural festivals
in the year, one after the transplanting of the young rice-plants,
another after the formation of the fruit, and a third after the
harvest<a id="FNanchor_1123" href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a>. As an example of a fully developed festival-cycle
of this kind I give the festivals of the Bontoc Igorot, with
which should be compared the section on the agricultural year
of this tribe<a id="FNanchor_1124" href="#Footnote_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a>. After the conclusion of the time when rice-seed
is put in the germinating beds, <i>pa-chog</i>, the festival <i>po-chang</i>
is held, after the transplanting of the rice the festival <i>chaka</i>
(held on Feb. 10 in 1903), and after that an unexplained
festival <i>su-wat</i>; on the day on which the first ‘fruit-heads’
have shown themselves on the growing rice there is the
festival <i>ke-eng</i>, and on the following day <i>tot-o-lod</i>; <i>sa-fo-sab</i>,
before the beginning of harvest, introduces the harvest. At
the end of the rice-harvest and the beginning of the period
called <i>li-pas</i> (‘no more rice-harvest’) <i>lislis</i> is celebrated; at the
time of the planting of camotes <i>loskod</i>; in the same division<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
of the year, called <i>bali-ling</i>, the festival <i>o-ki-ad</i>, when black
beans are planted. Finally at the end of this division we
have <i>ko-pus</i>, a three day’s rest, just before the work of
rice-culture is begun again<a id="FNanchor_1125" href="#Footnote_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a>. An African example from the
neighbourhood of the Lower Niger will shew how in this
agrarian festival-cycle other feasts arise which may in part
be older. The cycle consists of the following festivals:&mdash;1,
sacrifices and adoration to the great spirit or creator, always
made in anticipation of the new crop, to ensure that
it is good; 2, communion of first-fruits, a festival to the house-hold
gods; 3, communion of the new yam; 4, the feast of
hunters; 5, <i>ofala</i>, a celebration to Ofo, god of justice and
right, in honour of the public appearance of the king; 6,
the <i>crumbo</i>, or remnants of yam, reserved for the king only;
7, the feast of roast yam at the close of the year, the termination
of this marking the end of the native year and the
feast also serving as a form of public notice that farming has
to recommence. This is a festival in honour of <ins class="corr" id="tn-338" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'Ifejiohu, god'">
Ifejioku, god</ins> of the crops, as a token of gratitude on the part of the community
for a fruitful and prosperous year. It is usual for the
king to give a month’s notice before each ceremony takes
place<a id="FNanchor_1126" href="#Footnote_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a>.</p>

<p>A pastoral people may also have a well-developed festival-cycle
marking the points of the year which are important
for their herds. I quote as an example the main festivals of
the Reindeer Koryak of Eastern Siberia. There is a ceremony
on the Return of the Herd from the summer pastures, when
the first snow covers the ground. In spring, when the fawning
period is over and the reindeer have lost their antlers,
the fawn festival is celebrated. The fire in the house is put
out and a new one started by means of the sacred fire-board.
Some tribes pile up the antlers of the slaughtered reindeer.
Other festivals are observed:&mdash;1, when the sun marks the
approach of summer after the winter solstice: a sacrifice is
then offered to the sun; 2, in the month of March, when the
does commence to fawn: a sacrifice is offered to The-One-on-High;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
3, in spring, when the grass commences to sprout and
the leaves appear on the trees; 4, when mosquitoes put in
their appearance&mdash;reindeer are then slain as an offering to
The-One-on-High, lest the mosquitoes scatter the herd<a id="FNanchor_1127" href="#Footnote_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a>.</p>

<p>Here the development is simple and clear, but not so
among many peoples where agriculture or the raising of
cattle does not occupy so important a place. The Maidu of
northern California have four seasons and four festivals founded
by the hero Oankoitupeh:&mdash;‘the open air festival’ in the
spring, ‘the dry season festival’ about the first of July, ‘the
burning to the dead’ about the first of September<a id="FNanchor_1128" href="#Footnote_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a>, and ‘the
winter festival’ about the last of December<a id="FNanchor_1129" href="#Footnote_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a>. The connexion
with the seasons is clear, but we do not even know whether
the names are of genuine native origin. This example clearly
shews that the great difficulty lies in the fact that the real
nature of the festivals is unknown. But often where detailed
accounts of a festival exist, the original reason for it becomes
obscured in the course of the development, so that the original
connexion between festival and season cannot be established.
This is especially the case with peoples among whom
the religious life has had an especially strong development.</p>

<p>A phenomenon peculiar to the peoples of the far North
is that the winter is the time of the festivals. The summer
is the good season, when supplies for the winter must be collected;
it is therefore a very busy time, when each family
has to work for itself and has no leisure for festivals. The
winter is the time of rest, in which the people live on the
supplies already collected; they naturally crowd closer together,
and have much leisure, which is used for religious ceremonies
and for games. Hence the winter is the time of the
religious ceremonies among the Eskimos, the Tlinkit, and
other Indians of N. W. America<a id="FNanchor_1130" href="#Footnote_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a>, and hence the Yule festival<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
celebrated in the winter becomes the greatest festival of the
Scandinavian peoples<a id="FNanchor_1131" href="#Footnote_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a>.</p>

<p>When a festival takes place, people assemble together
who often have to come long distances. We have spoken
above<a id="FNanchor_1132" href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a> of the devices adopted in order to ensure that the day
of an appointed non-periodic festival shall not be missed. Periodically
recurring festivals, which are connected with a natural
phase or some occupation, particularly if this is agricultural,
are determined as to time, but not accurately. Hence
it is already found among the Central Australians that the
exact day is fixed by the chief. Such festivals, appointed
within certain limits assigned by Nature, are found also among
peoples with a fixed calendar, e. g. the Roman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">feriae conceptivae</i>.
Significantly enough, these are agricultural festivals
which, on account of the change of position of the lunisolar
year in relation to the natural year, could not well be regulated
by the former. But where a calendar exists, this is the
given means of regulating the festival dates so that preparations
can be made and the people can assemble at the right
time. In the natural and agricultural years the festivals are
in the proper sense <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conceptivae</i>; the question is properly to
find a means of accurately fixing the day within the short
periods given by Nature. This purpose is served by the calculation
from the moon. The moon herself has her festivals,
especially that of the new moon and, though more seldom,
that of the full moon<a id="FNanchor_1133" href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a>. Thus the festival times are regulated
by the moon. In itself any suitable day of the month can be
appointed as a feast-day, but custom and superstition cause
certain days to be preferred. Thus the day of new moon,
since it was often already a feast-day in itself, was bound to
be preferred. The Natchez of Louisiana, for instance, celebrated
at each day of new moon a feast which took its name
from the animals and plants which the preceding month had
principally brought forth, but the greatest festival was that
held at the new moon of the first month.<a id="FNanchor_1134" href="#Footnote_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span></p>

<p>It is a very wide-spread idea that things which are to
prosper and grow should be undertaken during the time of the
waxing moon, and that anything begun when the moon is on
the wane will dwindle and die. Hence the proper time for a
festival is the bright half of the moon, and especially the time
at which the moon has attained her full shape. It is not only
on account of the fair light which costs them nothing that the
negroes dance on the nights of full moon. In Dahomey the
festivals take place at the full of the moon, and the days are
determined by the native government<a id="FNanchor_1135" href="#Footnote_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a>. In Burma all religious
festivals with the exception of the New Year festival, the date
of which is regulated in a special manner, take place at the
time of full moon<a id="FNanchor_1136" href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a>. Throughout Australia, Tasmania, and
Melanesia the festivals begin either at full or new moon<a id="FNanchor_1137" href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a>.</p>

<p>In regard to the Israelitish festivals, the antiquity and
great importance of the new moon festival has already been
pointed out<a id="FNanchor_1138" href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a>. The Jews here follow a wide-spread custom.
Whether they, like many other peoples, also preferred the
time of full moon for their festivals, is a more difficult question.
A fixed day for the Passover and Feast of Unleavened
Bread and for the Feast of Tabernacles is first prescribed during
and after the Exile, the last-named on the fifteenth day
of the seventh month, the Feast of Unleavened Bread on the
fifteenth day of the first month, and the Passover on the
evening of the day before (the fourteenth of the first month)<a id="FNanchor_1139" href="#Footnote_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a>.
The only other information we have from ancient times as to
the date of the Feast of Tabernacles is contained in the earlier
name ‘Feast of Vintage’; it was celebrated after the conclusion
of the fruit-harvest and vintage. In regard to the
Feast of Unleavened Bread&mdash;since it is with this chiefly that we
have to do, not with the preliminary Feast of the Passover
associated with it, which was a feast of a different nature&mdash;the
order of the Yahwist runs ‘at the time appointed in the month
Abib’<a id="FNanchor_1140" href="#Footnote_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a>; as a motive is adduced the fact that the Jews came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
out from Egypt in this month. The Deuteronomist<a id="FNanchor_1141" href="#Footnote_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a> transfers
this to the preliminary festival. The time therefore, like that
of the Feast of Vintage, is determined by an event in agriculture,
but at the same time by the moon. Linguistically
<i>chodesh</i> can here mean ‘new moon’; in that case we could
also translate ‘at the time appointed after the new moon of
Abib’; but since the sense ‘month’ is so old and the original
sense ‘new moon’ appears unequivocally only where monthly
new moon festivals are in question<a id="FNanchor_1142" href="#Footnote_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a>, it seems reasonable to
translate the word here simply by ‘month’. Now it is often
stated that the festive seasons both of the Unleavened Bread
and of the Feast of Vintage were regulated purely by natural
circumstances: the former was celebrated when the first
ears ripened, and the latter when the fruit-harvest was at
an end, each according to local conditions. But the Feast
of Vintage at least was a general festival even in Canaanitish
days<a id="FNanchor_1143" href="#Footnote_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a>, and <i>moed</i> properly means ‘determined, appointed
time’. It was therefore not accidental circumstances but
a rule that in early times called the people together to
the festival. Chronological regulation is proved by the name
of the festival of harvest (<i>chag haq-qazir</i>), ‘Feast of Weeks’,
<i>chag shabuot</i> in the Yahwist<a id="FNanchor_1144" href="#Footnote_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a>. The regulation by the weeks,
however, is late and artificial in comparison with that by
the moon.</p>

<p>Now if we know what part was played by the time of
full moon in the festivals of other peoples, and indeed for the
agrarian peoples also, in spite of the differences in date resulting
from the observation of the time of full moon, it seems
always probable that the regulation of post-exilian times for
the fifteenth originated in an old tradition in accordance with
which the time of full moon was specially favoured for the feast.
Earlier the date was not so accurately observed; the time of
full moon was prescribed so that those who were prevented from
celebrating the Feast of the Passover at the proper time might
do so on the fourteenth of the following month<a id="FNanchor_1145" href="#Footnote_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a>. Unfortunately
the date of the passage in I Kings (XII, 32), according to which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
Jeroboam celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles on the 15th day
of the eighth month, is doubtful; if the passage is old, it
affords valuable evidence that the time of full moon was the
proper time for holding agrarian festivals<a id="FNanchor_1146" href="#Footnote_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a>.</p>

<p>Among the Greeks all the ancient festivals with the exception
of the feasts of Apollo, which always took place on
the seventh of the month, were concentrated in the period
shortly before and during full moon<a id="FNanchor_1147" href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a>. The selection of days
is organically connected with the lunar reckoning, and the
superstition of days has arisen independently among different
peoples. As an example the sacrifices of the Toba Batak of
Sumatra may serve. At the felling of a tree for house-building
sacrifices must be offered during the waxing moon; this is in
general the favourable time, since everything undertaken then
increases with the moon. The huntsman sacrifices to his god
at noon-tide about the time of new moon, the fisherman at
noon while the moon is waxing; before a military expedition
a certain sacrifice is offered (preferably in the early morning)
at the time of full moon, and another at the waxing moon<a id="FNanchor_1148" href="#Footnote_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a>.</p>

<p>This superstition, which involves the accurate knowledge
and observation of the days, and the injunction, to which great
religious importance is attached, to celebrate the festivals on the
proper days, lead to the result that the time-reckoning, which
arose in the first place from the events and necessities of practical
life, has among certain peoples passed completely under
the influence of religion and has been further developed from
ecclesiastical standpoints in the service of the religious cult.</p>

<p>There are however other ways of exactly fixing a day,
viz. by observation of the stars and of the solstices and
equinoxes. The former method is hardly ever used directly
as a means of determining religious dates, and this fact is
very significant for the practical character of the observation
of the stars. No religious ideas are associated with the
phases of the stars, although star-myths innumerable are related.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
The reason is not easy to discover. A contributory factor
may be that although the observation of the stars is wide-spread,
it is yet not a matter which concerns every man, and
also that the stars always give only a single point of time and
do not form cyclical periods within the year, though on the
other hand they are intimately connected with the phases of
the natural year and with agriculture. The principal reason
may be conjectured to be that the reckoning of months, on
account of its connexion with the popular festival seasons and
with the selection of days, has been from the beginning chiefly
carried out with a view to religious considerations.</p>

<p>It is only among certain peoples that the observation of
the solstices and equinoxes plays any great part, and that consequently
the religious importance of the sun is also great. But
the festivals of the solstices and equinoxes, recurring at regular
intervals in the course of the year, are far from being able to
compare with those of the phases of the moon. It has already
been mentioned that the Eskimos were able accurately to
observe the winter solstice<a id="FNanchor_1149" href="#Footnote_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a>. At this time, about the 22nd of
December, they held a festival to rejoice over the return of
the sun and the good hunting weather. They collected together
from all over the country in great parties, entertained one
another in the best possible manner, and when they had gorged
themselves to the full they got up to play and to dance<a id="FNanchor_1150" href="#Footnote_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a>.
Certain Indian peoples have made quite a special custom
of the observation of the solstices and equinoxes. Thus for
instance did the Inca people, but they had lunar months also,
and even the great festival of the sun in December was regulated
by the days of the lunar month<a id="FNanchor_1151" href="#Footnote_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a>. The Zuñi determine
the festival times by the observation of thirteen different positions
of the sun on the horizon, but they have also lunar months,
five of which are named from natural phases, and six from
colours borrowed from certain rites<a id="FNanchor_1152" href="#Footnote_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a>. The ceremonies are
therefore still distributed among the months, and the most obvious
explanation is that the observation of the thirteen positions of
the sun really serves to determine the thirteen months, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
with them the times of the rites. The old Mexican calendar
seems to have no connexion with the moon, but in Ginzel’s
opinion this does not exclude the possibility of an earlier
development on the basis of a relationship with the course of
the moon<a id="FNanchor_1153" href="#Footnote_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a>. In any case the regulation of the festivals by the
positions of the sun is a comparatively isolated separate development
among certain peoples; the regulation by the moon, on
the contrary, is found all over the world.</p>

<p>Because the calendar is principally looked upon as the
concern of religion, the months appear in such close association
with the festivals held in them that it is sometimes found that
the relationship to the phases of Nature falls into the background.
Among peoples who have no names of months, like
the Greeks of the Homeric period, or among those who name
only some of them, it may therefore happen that the months
become named from the festivals or perhaps that such names
supersede those which refer to natural phases. Thus, as has
been mentioned above, six months of the Zuñi year are named
from the colours of the prayer-sticks. Of the Inca months one
is named from a moon festival, two from provincial festivals,
and one from the great sun festival; the rest take their names
from the occupations of agriculture<a id="FNanchor_1154" href="#Footnote_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a>. Of the tribes of Bolivia
it is stated that their knowledge of the calendar is not
according to days, but according to the principal festivals<a id="FNanchor_1155" href="#Footnote_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a>.
In Africa two examples have been given<a id="FNanchor_1156" href="#Footnote_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a>, those of the Hausa
states and the Edo-speaking peoples. In the Babylonian calendar
the names of months derived from festivals spread more and
more, at the expense of names of other kinds<a id="FNanchor_1157" href="#Footnote_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a>. The phenomenon
is therefore comparatively rare and is found only among
peoples who have a highly developed religious cult, and even
in the examples here given the process is not consistently
carried out.</p>

<p>Consistency is found only in one case, the calendar of
ancient Greece, and is all the more striking since in the hundreds
of varying calendars of the town-states no names which
do not refer to festivals have been with certainty demonstrated;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
the few calendars with numbered months are of more recent
origin<a id="FNanchor_1158" href="#Footnote_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a>. The certain conclusion is that the Greek calendar
was entirely regulated from the point of view of the religious
cult. Where on the other hand the place of the lunisolar year
is taken by another reckoning, it is found that the lunar reckoning
is still used in the establishing of certain festivals, as
for instance in Bali<a id="FNanchor_1159" href="#Footnote_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a>, and by the Christians in the matter of
Easter and the festivals depending thereon.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-capy">As long as the determination of time is adjusted by the
phases of Nature which immediately become obvious to
everyone, anybody can judge of them, and should different
people judge differently there is no standard by which the
dispute can be settled, because the natural phases run into
one another or are at least not sharply defined. The accuracy
in determination demanded by time-reckoning proper is
therefore lacking. Accuracy becomes possible as a result of
the observation of the risings of stars, and this observation
begins even at the primitive stage, but it is not a matter that
concerns everyone. It requires a refined power of observation
and a clear knowledge of the stars, so that the heavens can
be known. This is especially the case with the commonest
observations, those of the morning rising and evening setting.
The observer must be able to judge, by the position of the
other stars, when the star in question may be expected to
twinkle for a moment in the twilight before it vanishes. The
accuracy of the time-determination from the stars depends therefore
upon the keenness of the observation. In this the individual
differences of men soon come into play, along with a
regular science which introduces the learner to the knowledge
of the stars and its uses. Thus Stanbridge reports of the natives
of Victoria that all tribes have traditions about the stars,
but certain families have the reputation of having the most
accurate knowledge; one family of the Boorung tribe prides
itself upon possessing a wider knowledge of the stars than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
any other<a id="FNanchor_1160" href="#Footnote_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a>. An account has been given above<a id="FNanchor_1161" href="#Footnote_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a> according
to which an old chief instructed the young people of the tribe
in the knowledge of the stars and the occupations which these
announce. Of the Torres Straits tribes Rivers says:&mdash;When
the rising of a star is expected, it is the duty of the old men to
watch; they rise when the birds begin to call and watch until
daybreak. As in the case of <i>kek</i> (Achernar, the most important
star), so also probably in the case of other important
stars and constellations the appearance of certain other stars
is a sign that the star expected will soon appear. For <i>kek</i>
the stars in question are two named <i>keakentonar</i>; when they
appear on the horizon at dawn, it is known that in a few
days <i>kek</i> will shew himself, and the observation becomes
especially keen. The setting of a star is observed in the
same way<a id="FNanchor_1162" href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a>.</p>

<p>By the phases of the stars both occupations and seasons
are regulated, and thus a standard is furnished by which to
judge, and a limit is set to the indefiniteness of the phases of
Nature. An old missionary relates of the Orinocese that it is
incredible how confused their minds become if they neglect
to observe the signs which make known the approach of winter;
they may then say in winter that one or two months are
yet wanting, and in the height of summer they sometimes
spread the report among their countrymen that the winter
will soon be upon them; the evening setting of the Pleiades
announces the coming of winter and therefore affords a means
of correcting the time-reckoning<a id="FNanchor_1163" href="#Footnote_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a>.</p>

<p>The moon strikes the attention of everyone and admits
of immediate and unpractised observation; at the most there
may sometimes be some doubt for a day as to the observation
of the new moon, but the next day will set all right.
But because the months are fixed in their position in the natural
year through association with the seasons, the indefiniteness
and fluctuation of the phases of Nature penetrate into
the months also, and are there even increased, for the reasons
stated above. Cause for doubt and disagreement is given, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
problem of the regulation of the calendar arises. Hence in
the council meetings of the Pawnee and Dakota it is often
hotly disputed which month it really is. So also the Caffres
often become confused and do not know what month it is;
the rising of the Pleiades decides the question. The Basuto
in determining the time of sowing are not guided by the lunar
reckoning, but fall back upon the phases of Nature; intelligent
chiefs however know how to correct the calendar by the
summer solstice<a id="FNanchor_1164" href="#Footnote_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a>.</p>

<p>The differences in intelligence already make themselves
felt at an early stage, and are still more plainly shewn when
we come to a genuine regulation of the calendar. Some of
the Bontoc Igorot state that the year has eight, others a
hundred months, but among the old men who represent the
wisdom of the people there are some who know and assert
that it has thirteen<a id="FNanchor_1165" href="#Footnote_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a>. The further the calendar develops, the
less does it become a common possession. Among the Indians,
for example, there are special persons who keep and interpret
the year-lists illustrated with picture-writings, e. g. the
calendrically gifted Anko, who even drew up a list of months<a id="FNanchor_1166" href="#Footnote_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a>.
It is very significant that even where a complete calendar
does exist, it will be found that this is not in use to its fullest
extent among the people. The Masai days of the month have
already been given<a id="FNanchor_1167" href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a>; but the nomenclature of the days is not
so popular throughout that any Masai on any day could determine
that day with perfect accuracy. Only the following
days and groups of days are in regular use:&mdash;The 1st day,
as the beginning of the counting and of the brightness of the
moon (<em>sic!</em>), the 4th as the new moon, the 10th as the final day
of the first decade, the 15th as the final day of the moon’s
brightness, the 16th as the beginning of the dark half of the
month, the 17th as the chief of the unlucky days, 18&ndash;20 as
<i>es sobiain</i>, the 20th as the final day of the second decade,
21&ndash;23 as <i>nigein</i>, the 24th as the beginning of ‘the black
darkness’, and from the 24th on to the disappearance of the
moon. Of these days the 4th, 10th, 17th, 24th, and 1st are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
especially common. The people therefore count in a more
concrete fashion than those who are learned in the calendar.</p>

<p>It follows that the observation of the calendar is a special
occupation which is placed in the hands of specially experienced
and gifted men. Among the Caffres we read of
special ‘astrologers’<a id="FNanchor_1168" href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a>. Among the Kenyah of Borneo the determination
of the time for sowing is so important that in
every village the task is entrusted to a man whose sole occupation
it is to observe the signs. He need not cultivate rice
himself, for he will receive his supplies from the other inhabitants
of the village. His separate position is in part due to
the fact that the determination of the season is effected by
observing the height of the sun, for which special instruments
are required. The process is a secret, and his advice is always
followed<a id="FNanchor_1169" href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a>. It is only natural that this individual should
keep secret the traditional lore upon which his position depends;
and thus the development of the calendar puts a still
wider gap between the business of the calendar-maker and the
common people.</p>

<p>Behind the calendar stand in particular the priests. For
they are the most intelligent and learned men of the tribe,
and moreover the calendar is peculiarly their affair, if the
development has proceeded so far that value is attached to
the calendar for the selection of the proper days for the religious
observances. We are not told that the Kenyah who
has charge of the calendar is a priest, but among the Kayan
(also of Borneo) it is a priest who determines the seed-time
from the observation of the ecliptic, and on the upper Mahakam
a priestess<a id="FNanchor_1170" href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a>. In Bali the Brahmins, in Java the village
priests, determine the seasons by observing a crude sun-dial<a id="FNanchor_1171" href="#Footnote_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a>.
Of the Tshi-speaking peoples it is said that the priests keep a
reckoning of the time, using different methods for the purpose,
and make known the approach of the annual festivals<a id="FNanchor_1172" href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a>. Among
the Hausa the priests determine the time of the festivals
according to the position of the moon<a id="FNanchor_1173" href="#Footnote_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a>; here also the months<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
are named after the festivals. To a very general extent it is
true among peoples like the Indians of Arizona, where the
religious ceremonies are the centre of the life of the tribe,
that the priests are the calendar-makers. Among the Hopi the
priests determine from the observation of the solstices and
equinoxes the time for the religious ceremonies and for the
agricultural labours<a id="FNanchor_1174" href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a>. Among the Zuñi the priest of the sun
is alone responsible for the calendar. He takes daily observations
of the sunrise at a petrified tree-stump east of the
village, which he sprinkles with meal when he offers his matins
to the rising sun. When the sun rises over a certain point
of the Corn Mountain he informs the elder brother Bow priest,
who notifies a certain religious body, the members of this society
come together and the great feast of the winter solstice
is then celebrated. The summer solstice and its festival are
determined in similar fashion<a id="FNanchor_1175" href="#Footnote_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a>.</p>

<p>Among the priests there is formed a special class whose
duty it is to make observations and keep the calendar in order.
Among the Hawaiians ‘astronomers (<i>kilo-hoku</i>) and priests’
are mentioned<a id="FNanchor_1176" href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a>; they handed down their knowledge from
father to son; but women, <i>kilowahine</i>, are also found among
them<a id="FNanchor_1177" href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a>. Elsewhere the nobles appear alongside of the priests;
thus in Tahiti it is the nobles that are responsible for the
calendar, in New Zealand the priests. In the latter country
there is said to have been a regular school, which was visited
by priests and chiefs of highest rank. Every year the assembly
determined the days on which the corn must be sown
and reaped, and thus its members compared their views upon
the heavenly bodies. Each course lasted from three to five
months<a id="FNanchor_1178" href="#Footnote_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a>.</p>

<p>For Loango it is reported that the king’s star-gazers
apparently took observations from a little wood; further that
they sometimes knew how to arrange matters to suit their
own convenience, for they gave out (probably when the sky<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
was clouded) that the moon was several days old, and thus
gained a couple of hours for the rising of Sirius and could
postpone the dreaded thirteenth month until the end of the
next year<a id="FNanchor_1179" href="#Footnote_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a>. In these districts, where a strong day-superstition
prevails, external influence is doubtless probable, but the account
is significant in that it speaks for an artificial retardation
of the calendar. Such a manipulation is characteristic of the
professed calendar-maker.</p>

<p>The king himself also takes charge of the calendar. The
Inca observed the solstices in person, and was assisted in so
doing by the cleverest of his people; the priests assembled to
determine the equinoxes<a id="FNanchor_1180" href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a>. The calendar of the Society Islands
was fixed by King Pomare and his family<a id="FNanchor_1181" href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a>. That the Inca appeared
in a priestly office for this purpose is certain; that
Pomare did the same is doubtful, since European influence has
no doubt been brought to bear upon this case.</p>

<p>The examples just given are not numerous, and this corresponds
to the actual state of affairs, since we have here to
do with the treatment of a genuine calendarial science by
certain peoples,&mdash;only at a quite undeveloped stage can questions
of the time-reckoning be dealt with in a deliberative
assembly&mdash;and our researches are concerned with primitive
peoples. The end which the calendar-maker has in view is
the establishing of an ordered series of days marked out into divisions,
the series being kept in place by certain fixed points,
and recurring cyclically. First of all the regulation of the
lunisolar calendar is his principal task, and it is one which
everywhere takes the chief place. For this purpose the calendar-maker
must become accurately acquainted with the course of
the sun and with the stars. Here the four solstices and equinoxes
are distinguished by their recurrence at tolerably regular
intervals of time; the stars however cannot of themselves be
brought into a system with equal intervals of time, but are
only applied to such a system in order to fix it. Hence it
follows that the observation of the solstices and equinoxes has,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
at least in single cases, been erected into a calendric system,
but the observation of the stars not so&mdash;except in Babylon&mdash;although
they also are observed, so that they come to be accurately
known, and the planets are even discovered, e. g. by the
Polynesians. The calendar and practical life become to some
degree separated from each other; the first lays the principal
emphasis upon the correct ordering of the series of days,
which is of especial importance on religious grounds for the
selection of days and the fixing of the right day for the religious
observances; in practical life, however, the point of chief
importance is to determine the times when the various occupations
may be begun and sea-voyages undertaken, both of which
depend upon the solar year, and for this the stars afford the
best aid. Hence it happens that sometimes the reckoning by
the stars appears, as one more profanely determined, in a
certain opposition to the lunisolar reckoning, which has a more
religious character. This happened in ancient Greece, where
the stars served for the time-reckoning of sailors and peasants
while the lunisolar calendar was developed and extended
under sacral influence; the festival calendar, which was regulated
and recorded by the moon, became the official civil calendar.
It was only later that the stellar calendar was systematically
brought under the influence of the fully developed
astronomy and of the Julian calendar.</p>

<p>In sailing, the stars afford to the primitive sea-faring
peoples the only means of finding their way when the land
can no longer be seen. From the necessities of sea-faring the
greatly advanced knowledge of the stars possessed by the South
Sea peoples has arisen; this is because practical ends are
served not by a priestly wisdom, but by a profane. Nevertheless
the knowledge of the stars is a secret which is carefully guarded
in certain families, and kept from the common people&mdash;as
is reported of the Marshall Islands<a id="FNanchor_1182" href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a>. Among the Moanu
of the Admiralty Islands it is the chiefs who are initiated by
tradition into the science of the stars<a id="FNanchor_1183" href="#Footnote_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a>. On the Mortlock
Islands, where the science of the stars is very highly developed,
there was a special astronomical profession; the knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
of the stars was a source of respect and influence, it
was anxiously concealed, and only communicated to specially
chosen individuals<a id="FNanchor_1184" href="#Footnote_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a>. Only a few can determine the hours of
night by the stars. The Tahitian Tupaya, who accompanied
Cook on his first voyage, was a man of this kind, specially
distinguished for his nautical knowledge of the stars<a id="FNanchor_1185" href="#Footnote_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a>. The
elements of the science, however, seem to have been pretty
generally known, and from the Caroline Islands comes a curious
account of a general instruction therein. It was first
mentioned by the Spanish missionary Cantova in the year
1721, and was later confirmed by Arago. In every settlement
there were two houses, in one of which the boys were instructed
in the knowledge of the stars, and in the other the
girls; only vague ideas were imparted, however. The teacher
had a kind of globe of the heavens on which the principal
stars were marked, and he pointed out to his pupils the direction
which they must follow on their various journeys. One
native could also represent on a table by means of grains of
maize the constellations known to him<a id="FNanchor_1186" href="#Footnote_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a>. This is a nautical,
non-priestly astronomy, which has really little to do with calendarial
matters in general, although as a matter of fact in
the Carolines and the Mortlock Islands it has led to the naming
of all months from constellations, and therefore to a
systematic sidereal regulation of the calendar<a id="FNanchor_1187" href="#Footnote_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a>.</p>

<p>On the other hand the priests also have observed the
stars and used their stellar science principally for sooth-saying,
as e. g. in Hawaii and in Babylonia. But neither does this
lead to any improvement of the calendar, since the religion
must keep to the existing lunisolar calendar, although in one
case of the most far-reaching importance the astrology arose
from it. The improving of the calendar, the object of which
must be, after the full development of the lunisolar, to return
to the solar calendar, in order that the calendar may be better
adapted to the needs of practical life, becomes henceforth the
task of the lay scientific astronomer.</p>

<h3>1. SUMMARY OF RESULTS.</h3>


<p class="drop-capy1">T<em>he concrete nature of the time-indications.</em> Any genuine
system of time-reckoning must admit of numerical treatment,
i. e. it must consist of divisions of which the length is strictly
limited and which, when they belong to the same order, are
as far as possible of the same length. A numerical conception
is abstract and not primitive; even the power of counting is
little developed among primitive peoples in general, and among
the lowest peoples it is extremely limited. Counting is abstract,
the primitive man clings to the concrete phenomena of the
outer world. In matters of chronology, therefore, he finds his
way not by counting but by referring to the concrete phenomena
the recurrence of which in definite succession experience
has taught him to expect. The first time-indications are therefore
not numerical but concrete. Their character clearly appears
e. g. when ‘a sun’ is said for ‘day’, and ‘a sleep’ for ‘night’;
the hours of day are denoted by the concrete phenomena of
the twilight, dawn, sunrise, etc., and the equally concrete
position of the sun or the occupations of the day. The lunar
month is usually called ‘a moon’, and its days are denoted by
the phases and position of the moon. The year is originally
neither a period of time nor the circle of the seasons (which
is first gradually developed under the influence of agriculture
in particular), but the produce of the year: e. g. it embraces
the time between sowing and harvest, and is often not a
complete year in our sense. Only gradually does the year
develop into the period of time that elapses between a season<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
and the recurrence of the same season, or more rarely between
a phase of a star and the return of the same phase.
From the latter period the genuine solar year has arisen. The
seasons are composed of occupations and of climatic and other
natural phenomena, and still preserve this concrete relationship
and are therefore not definitely limited in duration. This relationship
is also extended to the moons, which for their determination
are not numbered but are brought into connexion
with a natural phase and named accordingly, so that the twelve
to thirteen months of the year can be fixed as regards position
and succession. Even the Julian months, as they were introduced
among less cultivated peoples such as the ancient
Germans, the Slavs, etc., could not keep their names, since
these had no intelligible meaning or reference to a concrete
phenomenon; in order to provide for this the months were
re-christened with indigenous names which are of the same
kind as those given by the primitive peoples to their lunar
months. Or else, but much more seldom, the Latin name
acquired the concrete significance of a season. The years also
are not numbered, but are named from an important event,
so that their succession follows from the historical succession
of events, a method of denoting the year which prevailed
throughout antiquity in the <i>limmu</i>, archon, and consular
years, etc.</p>

<p><em>Discontinuous and ‘aoristic’ time-indications.</em> The starting-point
for the time-reckoning is therefore afforded by the concrete
phenomena of the heavens and of surrounding natural
objects, and the succession of these, fixed as it is by experience,
serves as a guide in the chronological sequence. These
phenomena extend over periods which are very dissimilar
to one another and are individually of varying length; they
cross and overlap in some cases, in others they leave gaps.
The time-indications are not directly connected with each
other, but this connexion is achieved by the phenomena in
question. Hence the indications are not circumscribed by one
another, but the phenomena as such are regarded. The latter
are not conceived of as divisions of time of a definite length;
they do not appear as parts of a larger whole, limited on both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
sides by their connexion with other divisions of time. The
conception of continuity, the immediate fusion of the chronological
phenomena into one another, is lacking: the time-indications
are discontinuous. We may speak, although not quite
correctly, of a discontinuous time-reckoning. We think, for
example, of the abundant sub-division of the times of day in
the morning and evening, and the small number of sub-divisions
in the night and day-time, of the many very unequal seasons
which encroach upon one another and overlap. General measures
for shorter periods of time are therefore not given by the time-indications
proper, but are derived from actions or occupations,
e. g. the time needed to traverse a well-known piece of road.
When a systematising of these time-indications takes place, e. g.
in the matter of the seasons, where only those of practical
importance are rendered prominent and are circumscribed,
there arise divisions of very unequal length, which are hardly
suitable for a genuine time-reckoning.</p>

<p>The times of day are often given by reference to the
position of the sun. In northern countries, where the length of
the daily course of the sun varies so greatly, points on the
horizon are sought out as an aid. Both these methods of indicating
the times of day may seem to afford a foundation for a
continuous reckoning, but this is not the case, since they always
refer only to the position of the sun at the immediate moment:
they are&mdash;to adopt a grammatical term&mdash;‘aoristic’. The discontinuity
is further shewn in the fact that it is only later and in an imperfect
fashion that the complete day and the year are joined
together in continuous circles. Day and night were combined
so late into the period of the complete day of 24 hours that
most languages are without a proper word to express this idea.
In the same way the reckoning was often long carried out in
half-years, winters and summers, or the years were of shorter
duration than the solar year (agricultural years, etc.).</p>

<p>The means of accurately determining the times and occupations
of the year is afforded by the phases of the stars,
which always recur at the same time of the year or at a time
subjected to only slight variations due to the conditions of observation.
A time-indication from phases of stars is properly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
of the discontinuous and ‘aoristic’ order, since a definite phase
of a star belongs theoretically to a certain day and practically
is also kept within very narrow limits. It is only with
great difficulty and some violence that the phases of the stars
can be systematised,&mdash;and that at a far-advanced stage: signs
of the zodiac, moon-houses&mdash;since they are distributed very
unequally over the year, this being due more particularly to
the limitation in practice to certain specially prominent stars.</p>

<p><em>The pars pro toto counting of the periods.</em> The regular
recurrence of the periods at once impresses itself upon the notice
of man: he may also feel the necessity of counting the periods.
As he always directs his attention to the single phenomenon
in itself, and not to its duration as given by the limitations
imposed by other phenomena, so he does not reckon the periods
of time as a continuous whole, but only counts an isolated
phenomenon recurring but once in the same period. When he
has seen ten harvests, he is ten years old: when nine new
moons have risen after conception, the nine months of
pregnancy are at an end: whoever has slept six nights on the
way has undertaken a six days’ journey. As counting-points
the times of rest&mdash;the nights and the winters&mdash;are especially
employed. Linguistically this method of counting still exists,
as when in most languages the complete day of 24 hours is
expressed by the word ‘day’, which also means day opposed
to night, or as in the Hebrew word for month, which really
means ‘new moon’. Popularly and in the language of poetry
this usage is still farther extended.</p>

<p>It is significant of the deep-rooted tendency to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pars
pro toto</i> method of counting that when peoples who are at a
less developed stage adopt such a continuous unit of time as
our seven-day week, they do not regard it as a unity, but put
the part for the whole. Weeks have been introduced into the
Society Islands, and the word <i>hebedoma</i> has there been adopted
to denote a week; it is however less frequently used by the
people than the word ‘sabbath’. When a native wishes to say
that he has been absent for six weeks on a journey, he usually
says six sabbaths or a moon and two sabbaths<a id="FNanchor_1188" href="#Footnote_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a>. Some of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
Islamite Malays of Sumatra count periods of time in Sundays,
others in Fridays, others again in market-days<a id="FNanchor_1189" href="#Footnote_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a>; these are therefore
the Christian, the Islamite, and the native methods of
reckoning weeks that here appear, but still the counting is
performed by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pars pro toto</i> method. The Old Bulgarian
word <i>nedelja</i> really means ‘day without work’, Sunday, but has
come to mean ‘week’<a id="FNanchor_1190" href="#Footnote_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a>.</p>

<p><em>The continuous time-reckoning</em> arises neither from the
daily course of the sun&mdash;which indeed is a unit but has no
natural sub-divisions&mdash;nor yet from the year, the consistent
length of which is at first concealed by the variation of the
natural phases. Moreover the year, though sub-divided, is divided
into parts (the seasons) which are indefinite and fluctuating
in their number, duration, and limits. The only natural
phenomenon which from the very beginning meets the demands
of the continuous reckoning is the moon. It is a fact
of importance that the course of the moon from the first appearance
of the new moon to the disappearance of the old is so short
a period that it may be surveyed even by the undeveloped
intellect. The decisive factor however is that not only is the
lunar month in itself a limited and continuous period of fixed
length, but it has also a natural sub-division into parts of equal
length, viz. days, each of which is clearly distinguishable
from its predecessor and successor by the shape of the moon
and its position in the sky at sunrise and sunset. However
these phases and positions also are at first described
concretely, and not numbered. The months, like other periods
of time, are counted by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pars pro toto</i> method in new
moons, or commonly in ‘moons’, as the days are counted
in suns. This is in itself a shifting mode of reckoning, which
proceeds from an arbitrarily chosen incidental point. With
primitive man’s undeveloped faculty of counting it can only
embrace a few months; the months of pregnancy, which
are so frequently counted, form a period which is quite sufficiently
long.</p>

<p><em>Empirical intercalation of months.</em> When a month not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
lying in the immediate past or future is to be indicated, the
concrete mode of reckoning comes to the fore in this case
also, and since a month covers a period of time which is relatively
long enough for the natural conditions seen in it to be
clearly distinguishable from those of the preceding and following
months, the month is named after these natural conditions,
i. e. it takes the name of a season. But this is not done
without confusion, for both seasons and months fluctuate in
reference to their position in the solar year, and the seasons
are not limited in length and duration, and still less do they
cover the months. Since any season and any natural phenomenon
may be used to determine a month, it follows that the
number of names of months is at first quite an arbitrary and
uncertain matter, and is far greater than that of the months
of the year. Linguistic custom leads to a natural selection in
which the names describing phenomena of special importance
are preferred. Thus a fixed series of months arises; and since
the year contains more than twelve and less than thirteen
lunar months, the series sometimes consists of twelve, sometimes
of thirteen months. The period thus arising is nothing
else than the lunisolar year, since the months through their
connexion with the seasons are bound up with the annual
course of the sun. The problem then arises how to make the
lunar months fit into the solar year. Practically the difficulty
first appears in a disguised form; primitive man has no conception,
or at most only an extremely vague idea, of the
length of the solar year. If the months are allowed to follow
one another in their traditional order the connexions with the
phases of nature are soon put out of gear, which never happened
so long as the relationship was occasional and fluctuating.
This defect must be corrected. When the series has
thirteen months, a month soon falls behind the natural phenomenon
from which it takes its name: one month must therefore
be omitted. This is the extracalation of a month. When
the series has twelve months, a month soon gets in front of
the natural phenomenon from which it takes its name. Then
the month is ‘forgotten’, i. e. it is regarded as non-existent,
and its name is given to the following month, from which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
point the series once more runs on correctly for some time.
This is the intercalation of a month. The necessity for the
omission or intercalation is recognised in the first place from
the natural phases: their fluctuation makes matters still worse.
Hence there often arise hot disputes as to which month it
really is, i. e. really, theoretically speaking, as to the inter- or
extracalation of a month. A fixed order arises in this intercalation
or omission when its arrangement is entrusted to the
priests, a body of officials, or even to a single person appointed
for the purpose, as among the ancient Semitic peoples
and in Loango.</p>

<p>Since the seasons are regulated by the phases of the
stars, the months can also be named after these phases and
regulated by them, and a very accurate and practical means
of regulation is thus afforded. When a phase of a star does
not appear in the month to which it gives its name, the month
is ‘forgotten’, the next month brings round the phase in question,
and takes its name. A series of twelve months is here
assumed; in the series of thirteen the phase of the star appears
too early, consequently the month-name which is in the series is
crowded out by the following month-name, which is derived from
the name of the star in question. Cases of doubt seldom arise
here, since they can only occur in the exceptional instance when
the phase of the star falls on the border-line between two months.</p>

<p>By means of a properly treated empirical intercalation
of this nature the series of months could be kept in fair agreement
with the phases of nature, and also, especially when the
phases of the stars were used as an aid, with the solar year.
Where, as in Babylonia, the sense of the observation of the
heavens was developed, there thus arose a fruitful problem
for the rudimentary and still quite empirical astronomy, viz.
that the astronomical points of regulation for the arrangement
of the lunar months within the solar year had to be determined
by more and more refined observation. So accurate
an empirical regulation must keep the intercalation in very
good order, as it did in Babylonia as early as the time of
Dungi in the latter part of the third millennium B. C. Meanwhile
there must have arisen of itself the knowledge that in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
a certain number of years a certain number of intercalations
always fell; the simplest relationship is three intercalary months
to eight years. The intercalation might then very well have
been cyclically regulated, but there was no reason for departing
from ancient custom, since the old method worked well and
there was no need to be able to calculate the calendar for a
long period in advance. This is in practice seldom necessary&mdash;how
often, for instance, is it necessary to-day to determine
years beforehand the position of Easter?&mdash;but for scientific
astronomy it is a necessity to be able thus to calculate in
advance. Hence it agrees very well with the flourishing of
the theoretical astronomy in the time of the Persians that an
intercalary cycle should be introduced about the year 528 B. C.</p>

<p>Seasons and months may also be regulated by points of
the annual course of the sun; but these are difficult to observe,
and for their observation landmarks, and therefore a
fixed dwelling-place, are required. Even then it is only the
two solstices that are accessible to primitive observation, and
this is specially easy in northern latitudes only. Hence the
solstices and equinoxes play a comparatively unimportant part
in the history of time-reckoning.</p>


<h3 class="p2">2. THE GREEK TIME-RECKONING<a id="FNanchor_1191" href="#Footnote_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a>.</h3>

<p>I pass on finally to speak of the Greek time-reckoning.
The problem is here not only the independent appearance of
a time-reckoning which is in all respects genuinely continuous,
but also the cyclical regulating of the intercalation.</p>

<p>In the Homeric poems the time-reckoning stands at a
primitive stage, and is indeed lower than among many barbaric
peoples. Very few natural times of day are recognised,
the days are counted by dawns, according to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pars pro
toto</i> method. Four larger seasons are known, but also smaller
ones, e. g. attention is paid to the birds of passage. Certain
phases of stars are known, and also the solstices<a id="FNanchor_1192" href="#Footnote_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a>. The lunar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
months are counted, e. g. the months of pregnancy<a id="FNanchor_1193" href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a>, but not
named; the day of new moon is celebrated. In Hesiod the
same time-reckoning appears further developed, a fact which
is due partly to the nature of the contents of his poem, partly
to its later date; in particular, phases of stars and smaller
seasons are frequently mentioned, and it is a great advance that
the days are numerically reckoned; they are counted in one
case from the solstice, and further the days of the month are
counted, sometimes in half-months, sometimes in decades.<a id="FNanchor_1194" href="#Footnote_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a>
In the appendix of the <em>Days</em> an exceedingly strong day-superstition
shews itself.</p>

<p>When history begins, the Greek time-reckoning as we
know it appears: it is a lunisolar year with named lunar months,
in which the intercalation is cyclically regulated, so that in a
period of eight years (Oktaeteris) a month is three times intercalated,
viz. in the 3rd, 5th, and 8th years. This appearance
of an ordered form of year and a cyclical intercalation
is completely unprepared for. We miss that association of
the months with the seasons and the naming after these which,
as the preceding investigations have shewn, alone gives rise
to an empirical intercalation. The investigation of primitive
time-reckoning has led to the perception that herein lies the
crucial point of the problem of the origin of the Greek time-reckoning.
In my opinion the Greek calendar cannot be explained
from premisses originating in the country itself, and
therefore cannot have arisen of itself in Greece.</p>

<p>The regulation of the Greek calendar has throughout a
sacral character. The idea of the selection of lucky or unlucky
days prevails not only in superstition but also in the
official religious cult. Most of the old festivals fall, according
to universal custom, either during or shortly before the time
of full moon; the festivals of Apollo form an exception and
are all celebrated on the 7th, those of his twin sister Artemis
being held on the preceding day, the 6th. The names of
months appear in sharp contradistinction to the world-wide
method of nomenclature in that they all, in so far as they are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
explainable, are derived from festivals. Several hundred names
are known from the various states of the mother country and
the colonies, and among these there is only a single exception to
the rule just stated, viz. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἁλιοτρόπιος</span>, i. e. the solstice month,
which belongs to later times, besides a few unexplained names,
such as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Γεῦστος, Δίνων</span>; numbered months were first created
among the leagues of states of the period after Alexander the
Great, in order to introduce a means of common understanding
such as was necessitated by the multiplicity of the local calendars.
These cases are all quite isolated and cannot disturb the rule.</p>

<p>The inference that may be drawn in regard to the months
from their names and from the ordering of the religious cult
is further established by other matters in regard to the cyclical
intercalation. The eight-year intercalary cycle cannot be distinguished
from the <i>Ennaeteris</i> period (so called according to
the Greek inclusive method of reckoning, the eight-year period
according to our method of expression) of certain festivals.
Such festivals are only known at Delphi, where three of them
were held (Charila, Stepterion, Herois). The great Pythian games
themselves were originally held every eighth year, and then,
after the first holy war (probably in the year 582, from which
the Pythiads were counted), every fourth year. Since eight
years seemed too long an interval, the period was halved in
order to secure a more frequent celebration, and the Isthmian
and Nemean games were even held every second year, i. e.
the period was divided into four. The Olympiad reckoning will
go still farther back, if the traditional starting-point, the year
776 B. C., is to be accepted. However the authenticity of the
older portion of the list of Olympian victors has been sharply
disputed, though the criticism certainly seems to have weakened
a little quite recently. But a peculiarity attaches to this festival,
viz. that it is celebrated alternately in one of the two
consecutive months, Apollonios and Parthenios<a id="FNanchor_1195" href="#Footnote_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a>. This can only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
be explained as follows:&mdash;The Oktaeteris has 99 months.
Originally the Olympic festival was not fixed according to the
calendar, but the date was simply arranged by the numbering
of the months of the Oktaeteris, in which the first half of the
Oktaeteris was given 50 months and the second 49. In the
calendarial Oktaeteris, on the other hand, there is an intercalation
once in the first half and twice in the second, i. e.
the first four years have 49 months and the next four 50;
hence it follows that when the old custom was to be preserved
in regard to the date, the month of the festival necessarily
varied in the given manner. When the chronological arrangement
of the Olympic games was introduced, the Oktaeteris calendar
therefore was not known, but only the Oktaeteris period.</p>

<p>The introduction of the calendar was effected in the form
of the establishment of <i>fasti</i> for festivals and religious cult, in
which the periodically recurring notable events of the cult,
viz. sacrifices and festivals, were noted down in calendrical
succession and in some cases also described. Fragments of
these <i>fasti</i> from later times have in several cases come down
to us, and similar <i>fasti</i> formed part of the legislation of Solon.
Solon in the year 594 arranged the sacral <i>fasti</i> of Athens, and
with them the calendar. That he was the first to introduce
the calendar cannot be stated; there is no evidence to shew
that the specific peculiarities of the Athenian calendar were
introduced by him. The evidence is however valuable as a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terminus ante quem</i>. Plato in his <cite>Laws</cite> prescribes that the
legislation shall arrange the festivals according to the decrees
of Delphi. Here, as elsewhere in the <cite>Laws</cite>, he returns to the
general Greek custom. The <i>fasti</i> were therefore arranged
under the superintendence of Delphi, and Solon also had
certainly done the same, for he stood in other respects in
close connexion with Delphi. In addition to which Geminos
mentions “the commandment of the laws and the oracular decrees,
to sacrifice in three ways, i. e. monthly, daily, yearly”. At
a later period also, those who superintended the calendar were
men learned in sacral matters. Thus the seer Lampon, at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>
time of the Peloponnesian War, brought forward a proposal for
the intercalation of a month; he was an <i>exegetes</i> and perhaps
even <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πυθόχρηστος</span>.</p>

<p>From all this it follows that it was the necessity for the
regulation of the religious cult that first created the calendar
in Greece. The succession of days in the year was in the first
place arranged in the form of sacral <i>fasti</i>, and this arrangement
was followed by the official civil calendar, while the
peasants and sailors kept to the reckoning by phases of the stars.
All indications&mdash;especially the above-mentioned festivals of
Delphi, the dictum of Plato, etc.&mdash;seem to shew that this regulation
originated at Delphi; not that it was actually enjoined by the
oracle, but the necessity for the regulation was aggravated
there, and its performance was therefore supported and superintended.
Only in Delphi could the requisites for the carrying
out of such a work be found united. It is the business of the
oracle to maintain peace with the gods, and this is above all
achieved through the proper cult, in which the dates are of
the greatest importance, no less important indeed than the
expiation of murder and the veneration of the heroes. In the
<i>pylagorai</i> and <i>hieromnemones</i>, who met twice a year for deliberation,
and in the <i>exegetai</i> there was a circle closely connected
with Delphi, each member of which could spread in his own
state the ideas he there imbibed<a id="FNanchor_1196" href="#Footnote_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a>. Certain states maintained
special officials who fostered the connexion with Delphi, such
as the Pythioi of Sparta, the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐξηγηταὶ πυθόχρηστοι</span> of Athens.
And, above all, it is only thus that the consistently sacral
character of the Greek calendar and names of months in general
can be satisfactorily explained.</p>

<p>There remains something to be added, viz. that, as has
been remarked above, all the festivals of Apollo of which the
date is known&mdash;and they are not few in number&mdash;fall on
the 7th, on which day also the birth of the god was celebrated
at Delphi and elsewhere. It is clear that this is a
definitely intended regulation. Otherwise, too, Apollo is the
patron of the reckoning in months. Even in Homer the day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
of new moon is a feast of Apollo, and later, as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Νεομήνιος</span>, i. e.
new-moon god, he receives sacrifices on the first of each month.
The initial day of the third decade was also dedicated to him,
for which reason he was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Εἰκάδιος</span>. He is without a rival
in his importance for the selection of days, which is dependent
upon the reckoning in months.</p>

<p>Now, according to the data given above, the cyclical
intercalation was introduced before the beginning of the 6th
century, most probably in the 7th; at most, on the strength of
Hesiod and of Homer (who in the Odyssey knows only the
beginning of the development, viz. Apollo as the god of the
new-moon festival), we may go back to the 8th. But it has
already been pointed out that in Greece the preliminary conditions
for the arising of even the empirical intercalation, and
much more of the cyclical, are lacking. Whence then has the
latter come? This is the real enigma in connexion with the
problem of the origin of the Greek time-reckoning. In my
opinion the question can only be answered in one way: it has
come from without, from the east, and originally from Babylonia.
Here we are met with the difficulty that an intercalary
cycle was not introduced into Babylonia before the 6th century.
But, as we have already remarked, the knowledge that in
eight years the lunar months could be brought by the intercalation
of three months to fit into the solar year must have
been reached long before, through a regular administration of
the intercalation, although in Babylonia, where the intercalation
was managed by a central authority, there was no reason for
erecting this knowledge into a rule. In Greece matters were
quite different. The land was split up into a great number of
little states in one of which it might often happen that there
was no one who could properly manage an empirical intercalation.
And even if there were, the empirical intercalation
must soon have led to variations in all these different states,
and hopeless confusion must have arisen. Since Delphi was
not a central court which could look after the intercalation,
there must be established, if order was to be created,&mdash;and
the whole movement started with this idea&mdash;a cycle which
should be binding in the future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span></p>

<p>It seems to me a well-authorised view that the god
Apollo came to Greece from Asia, and even apart from this
there is reason to suppose that in the religion of Apollo there
is a Babylonian element, viz. the prevailing importance of the
seventh day of the month in the cult of the god. A similar
preference for the seventh day of the month is seen again in
the <i>shabattu</i>. And in point of fact it is originally only the seventh
day that is brought into prominence, the other <i>shabattu</i> being
a later development from this<a id="FNanchor_1197" href="#Footnote_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a>; most of the Apollo festivals
were rites of expiation and purification, and the <i>shabattu</i> also
are distinguished as such. The calendar also shews a second
trace of connexion with Asia Minor. Besides Apollo there is
only one deity, Hecate, that is closely connected with the calendar
and the superstition of the days of the month, and it has
been proved that this goddess too originated in Asia Minor<a id="FNanchor_1198" href="#Footnote_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a>.</p>

<p>When the intercalary cycle was introduced from the East
about the 7th century it did not come alone, but formed part
of a mighty stream of civilisation which poured into Greece
from the East at an early period. This is shewn e. g. in art,
where all the styles formed under Oriental influence displace
and transform the native geometrical style in vase-painting
and the minor arts. Even in astronomy Oriental influence can
be demonstrated. Astronomical science begins with Thales, who
foretold the famous eclipse of the sun on May 28, 585 B. C.
According to one isolated notice he also concerned himself
with the lunisolar calendar. But the Ionian astronomy has
a Babylonian foundation; evidences of this are the division of
the day into 12 hours, and the signs of the zodiac, of which at
least three can be shewn to be of Babylonian origin, and one
is an Old Ionic transformation of a Babylonian original. But,
it is said, the way from Ionia to the mother country is long,
and the development of the mother country is in arrears.
But even with Delphi the Ionians had early connexions; we
may remember Croesus of Lydia. In the sixth century the eastern
Greeks established splendid treasure-houses at Delphi, and long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
and intimate connexions must have preceded buildings of this
nature. All the necessary conditions for the development assumed
can therefore be demonstrated, as well as can be expected
from the scanty nature of our sources for this period.</p>

<p>The introduction of the cyclical regulation of the calendar
has again introduced problems of far-reaching significance for
scientific astronomy, though now upon a higher plane. The
eight-year cycle was inaccurate, the problem was to find a
more exact one, and how fruitful this problem became is shewn
by such names as Meton and Kallippos. This difficulty prepared
the way for the emancipation of the time-reckoning from the
fetters of the religious cult.</p>

<p class="p1">Prof. Beckman has kindly pointed out to me that according
to Are’s <cite lang="is" xml:lang="is">Islendingabók</cite>, ch. 7 (<i lang="is" xml:lang="is">þá vas þat mælt et næsta sumar
áþr i lǫgum, at menn scyllde svá coma til alþinges, es X vicor
være af sumre, en þangat til quómo vico fyrr</i>), the Althing in
the year 999 A. D. was decreed for the time when ten (instead
of nine) weeks of the summer had passed, i. e. it was postponed
until a week later in the calendar. The reason for this is undoubtedly
that the calendar (the week-year), and with it the Althing,
had contrived to antedate itself a little more than a week
in relation to the natural year, after Torsten Surt’s reform of
the calendar had been introduced about the year 965. Here
therefore we have an example of the empirical and occasional
correction of the Icelandic calendar which was postulated above.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_336" href="#FNanchor_336" class="label">[336]</a> Bilfinger has brought forward
his opinion with great penetration and wide learning, but his reasoning
cannot stand before a searching criticism such as that amassed by
Ginzel, III, 58 ff., and Brate, <cite lang="sv" xml:lang="sv">Nordens äldre tideräkning</cite>, Program of the
Södermalm College, Stockholm, 1908, pp. 17 ff., and in particular developed
and more profoundly based by Beckman, <cite lang="sv" xml:lang="sv">Alfræði</cite>, Intro. pp. 1 ff.; cp. an article
by the same author in the Norwegian periodical <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Maal og Minne</cite>, 1915, p. 198.
I might content myself with a simple reference to Beckman, since I agree
with him on all important points, but as his article is written in Swedish
and is therefore probably inaccessible to many, I add the following note which
in the main was written long before it now appears, originally in connexion
with my studies in the primitive history of the Christmas festival, worked out
in the year 1914.</p>

<p>In point of fact it seems as though the objection which Bilfinger in
his study of the Yule-tide festival, II, 120, note, makes against the criticism
of Finnur Jonsson has not been answered (before Beckman): the objection
is that no notice is taken of the fundamental idea of Bilfinger’s work on the
Old Icelandic year&mdash;the cardinal point around which his whole demonstration
revolves&mdash;viz. the relation of the Old Icelandic calendar to the calculation
of Easter. Granting that the still heathen Icelanders or Norwegians
knew the week (the Germanic peoples took over the week while yet in their
heathen period, see my <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Studien zur Vorgeschichte des Weihnachtsfestes</cite>,
Archiv f. Religionswiss., 19, 1918, p. 118) and made use of it in counting
time, and that they later learnt approximately to know the length of the year&mdash;which
is very easily conceivable in view of their lively intercourse with other
nations&mdash;we have the elements out of which their calendar was developed, viz.
the week and the year. To these must be added the old-established divisions
of the year, summer and winter, which, on account of their importance for
civil life, were introduced as fixed periods of time into the calendar. As a
result of the adjusting of the reckoning in weeks to the year of 365, in leapyear
366, days, there arose a week-year with periodic interpolations of an embolimic
week. This of necessity agrees with Bilfinger’s so-called ‘mean
Easter year’, since both are constructed out of the same elements, it being
assumed only that the week-days of the one calendar correspond to those of
the other, and this is the case, since the week came to Iceland from the
south. Bilfinger is not correct in calling (I, 71) the shifting Easter period
a fragment of a week-year: in so doing he shuts his eyes to what he
himself terms the quinary factor, i. e. that Easter Sunday falls varyingly on
one of the five Sundays between March 22 and April 25 (the other days of
the Paschal term being fixed accordingly). This fact, as has long ago been
observed, makes the Easter period a fragment of a lunisolar year. A further
development would lead to a lunisolar year that also took into account the
reckoning in weeks. Bilfinger’s view of the matter is that the Icelanders for
the sake of convenience eliminated the quinary factor from the Easter reckoning
by taking the mean Easter Thursday as a fixed point of departure
instead of letting the calendar follow the actual variation of this day: this
roundabout method is unnecessary since the same result is arrived at by
basing a system of time-reckoning on the year and the week. The aim of
the Icelandic calendar, according to Bilfinger, was to fix the beginning of
summer, a legally very important term. If this was the object in view it
was, as Brate remarks (p. 21), not attained, for this day, Thursday of the
week April 9&ndash;15, may fall in the Passion week so that it becomes useless
for all business purposes. This proves on the contrary that the fixing of the
beginning of summer is pre-Christian.</p>

<p>The last objection to Are’s account of the introduction of the Icelandic
calendar, which Finnur Jonsson and Brate have allowed to stand, must also fall.
According to Are the cyclical interpolation of a week was introduced by Torsten
Surt about 960 A. D., while previously the year had 52 weeks, i. e. 1¼ days
too few. Bilfinger objects that such a year is unthinkable, since in the course
of 40 years it must anticipate itself by 50 days, and therefore in 292 years
must have run through the whole circle of the seasons: the mid-winter festival
must therefore for one generation have fallen in summer. Theoretically
the objection is valid, but in practice not so (cp. the Egyptian shifting year),
and the old calendars are administered practically. In the effort to arrive at
an embolimic cycle mistakes are at first made, and the agreement with the
solar year is once more brought about by means of intercalations irregularly
introduced for practical reasons. How the ancient Roman calendar was treated
we know: by the end of the Republic it had become thoroughly disorganised
as a result of intercalations made for political purposes. Moreover the Roman
year with its average length of 366¼ days was from the beginning not
a whit better than the year of 364 days ascribed by Are to the Icelanders
before Torsten Surt. We learn from inscriptions that in Athens still more
irregular intercalations were made during the last decades of the 5th century.
Such intercalations are the ruin of any system, but chronology must work with
a system, and this fact often blinds the eye of the chronological student to
the irregularity in the practical treatment of the calendar. Irregular intercalations
of this kind are not indeed attested for Iceland, but it is evident that
they must always appear of themselves in a defective calendar. The possibility
of a treatment of this kind existed, since the spokesman of the laws
had to proclaim publicly every year to the assembled people in the Althing
notices about the calendar for the following year, among which the announcement
of the intercalation held a special place. In these arguments I
find myself in agreement with Beckman: I also agree with his statement as
to the gradual increase in accuracy in the formation of the Icelandic week-calendar
under the influence of the ecclesiastical calendar.</p>

<p>We conclude then that the cardinal points of the Icelandic calendar,
which recur throughout Scandinavia and fall about three weeks behind the
equinoxes or the solstices, are not of Christian origin: the agreement with
what Bilfinger terms the ‘mean Easter Thursday’ is accidental. The date
is due to climatic conditions. A contributory factor may have been the
circumstance that mid-winter and midsummer fall just at the places where a
shortening or lengthening of the day becomes observable.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_911" href="#FNanchor_911" class="label">[911]</a> I cannot go further into this, but refer to Ginzel, I, 243 ff., though
he has far from exhausted the subject. Wellhausen’s treatment (l. c.) is
suggestive but too dogmatic, and he leaves the <em>nasî</em> out of account. More
recently Moberg has examined in detail the Arabian traditions: for particulars
of his researches I refer to his paper, <cite lang="sv" xml:lang="sv">Den muhammedanska traditionen
i fråga om an-nasî</cite>, St. Tegn., pp. 465 ff. His conclusion is that originally
<em>nasî</em> was partly the term for the insertion of the intercalary month, and
also probably the name of the intercalary month itself.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_915" href="#FNanchor_915" class="label">[915]</a> I give here the English translation of Sachau, p. 73, which adds <em>rabi I</em>
in brackets as an explanation. I am indebted to Prof. Moberg for the literal
translation of the passage:&mdash;“The first <em>nasî</em> fell in the <em>muharram</em>, and <em>safar</em>
was called by this name and <em>rabi I</em> by the name <em>safar</em>, and from this they
let the months revolve in the series. The second <em>nasî</em> fell in <em>safar</em>, and the
month following that (<em>rabi I</em>: Sachau) was again called <em>safar</em>, and so on,
until the <em>nasî</em> had run through all twelve months and came back again to
<em>muharram</em>.” As a result of the first intercalation <em>rabi I</em> became <em>safar</em>,
therefore <em>rabi II</em> = <em>rabi I</em>, after the second the names are pushed another
stage forwards, therefore the original <em>safar</em> = after the first intercalation
<em>rabi I</em>, after the second <em>rabi II</em>. I have added a reference to the original
situation.</p>

the month as ‘the one that has been curtailed of its rights’ (cf. Icel. <i>hornungr</i>),
since it has fewer days than the others: cf. the Flemish term <i>het kort mandeken</i>.
The same writer, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zts. f. deutsche Wortforschung 5</cite>, 1903, pp. 263 ff.,
satisfactorily explains <i>Sporkel</i> as the month in which the vines are pruned;
the name <i>Rebmonat</i> has the same sense. Further he conjectures that as
November is the slaughtering month and <i>Louwmaend</i> (= January) is the tanning
month, <i>Sellemaend</i> takes its name from the sale of the hides.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1027" href="#FNanchor_1027" class="label">[1027]</a> Beckman, <em>loc. cit.</em>, tries to prove the heathen origin of the computation
of the <i>disting</i> and its independence of the Easter reckoning by the statement
that the former follows the phenomena of the heavens, the latter the
rule of computation, which may lead to a different result. Unfortunately this
conclusion cannot be considered too binding, since for the people in general,
who knew nothing about this rule,&mdash;how late in medieval times the rune-staves
appeared we do not know, but certainly not at the beginning of the
Middle Ages&mdash;it was still absolutely necessary to determine in some degree
the time of fasting and the Easter time. And if the absolutely correct calculation
could not be made, it was still better than nothing to have one that
was at least approximate and easy to make. The fact that the moon of
fasting was calculated from the phenomena of the heavens is expressly stated
in the rule as given <a href="#Page_301">above, p. 301</a>.</p>

Studies, 39</cite>, 1919, 177) tries to explain this alternation by the intercalation;
if a month was intercalated the games would be transferred from Parthenios
to Apollonios. This is in my opinion impossible. The Greek feasts were bound
up with the months, which were named from some of them; this association
prevented a feast from being transferred to a month with another name, i. e.
the feast was fixed with reference to the name of the month, not to its number.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
